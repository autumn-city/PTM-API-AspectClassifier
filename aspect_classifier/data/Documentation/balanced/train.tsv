0	and 1. i use straight and simple CODETERM6 2.
0	) Tutorial Comments** Overall Im not sure exactly who the tutorial was aimed at - because there is a fair degree of assumed knowledge all round, so coming into REST and Restlet framework cold leaves you with a lot of catchup work to do, and re-reading paragraphs over and over again.
1	again no encoding.
0	user268098: I think most Java JSON handling libraries have issues with cyclic dependencies, and most have some ways to either exclude just references, or handle them with annotations (I added an answer in the other question to point out one way to do that with Jackson).
0	Its a mix of the two packages.
0	Thanks for the shout out for the Dropwizard OpenID project.
0	Contrary to a popular misconception HTTP is a fairly complex protocol.
0	See the commet by ChristofferHammarstrm in the answer by HarryLime.
1	Well youre doing N-1 redundant seeks, and last time I looked at it, which is decades ago, seek was a surprisingly expensive operation.
1	Many thanks, Option 1 (which seems more elegant) worked for me with Hibernate 3.6.0.Final and JBoss 4.2.1.GA.
1	YMMV.
1	Anyone knows some good SQL builder library for Java like URL_http://code.google.com/p/squiggle-sql/ [Squiggle] (not maintained anymore it seems).
0	In the Netbeans IDE help file, if you search for swing you will find a page titled about the swing application framework.
1	To use it you would have an object like this... CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	Anyway, the only good way Ive found to find the NPE thrower in these cases is the following kind of refactoring: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	I just commented on reference to expected good performance.Feature-set wise Jackson handles all the same nesting, layering, generics, so thats not where speed difference comes from.Having getters and setters does not impact performance in any measurable way (for packages I am aware of), so definitely can have them there.
1	Im sure Swing has still a long life to live (at least 2 or 3 more years).
1	(Dang it!
0	@S.Lott - Agreed.
1	Some parsers do not understand things like CSS.
0	Or stay and learn to like all the open source stuff that Java gives you.
0	URL_http://hc.apache.org/ [Apache-HttpComponents] .
1	or CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .
0	I recently needed an encryption algorithm that worked across multiple platforms (Java & C#).
1	See more focussed question here: URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7782720/when-to-move-from - container-managed-security-to-alternatives-like-apache-shiro.
1	There is no optional case: either one or (more likely) the other is correct.
1	Which, just... no.
0	Can anyone please suggest a suitable nlp library for this??
0	Are there other ideas or frameworks which offer lets say JMS over HTTP.
0	And how do I get rid of it?
0	After all, you can hack something out in very little time and put the resulting lash-up online.
1	I fully understand why this happens, but it is not ideal for what were trying to achieve.
0	Three connections can be faster than one, briefly at the start of a transfer.
0	I get java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header.
1	URL_http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/ [Guava] has a method similar to the one from Commons IOUtils that Willi aus Rohr mentioned: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	Changing these line CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	It works though I still feel there is probably a better/cleaner solution.
1	 if you need to be specific about the input streams encoding, you can provide the second argument to CODETERM1 constructor that indicates what charset to use (e.g.
1	You can set exception breakpoints in Eclipse as well.
0	Few that comes to mind: URL_http://couchdb.apache.org/ [CouchDB] URL_http://cassandra.apache.org/ [Cassandra] .
1	Check it out here: URL_http://reference.terracotta.org/examinator [ URL_http://reference.terracotta.org/examinator ] .
0	Signup, 2.
0	(I am willing to map them to objects coz it will be much more comfortable for me to manipulate the fields inside each file via object) I wonder if any of you deal with such things before?
1	(disclaimer: I work at Sun and I am in the GF team) I agree that Seam works fine on GlassFish; see URL_https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/tags/seam [ URL_https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/tags/seam ] GFv3 is quite different than JBoss 5; in particular: GFv3 is based on OSGi while JBoss 5s kernel is based on JMX.
0	Swing apps no loger feel jerky and unrepsonsive and an accumulation of minor improvements result in a more professional looking GUI.
0	Your first criteria might be a little bit subjective.
1	Can you package the native DLLs with your app?
0	In order to make your code work, I had to use this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream() (using Eclipse with a maven project).
0	Just the Shiro jar.
0	I am assuming there is a fudge factor anyway.
1	I had to add if (is null) return ; right at the beginning of the method; I believe this answer needs to be updated to better handle null inputStreams.
1	This may be desirable, or unintended.
0	ASN.1).
1	Never tried with Z.
0	Hibernate is already a core component of my solution so its not introducing a new dependency.
1	To wit: URL_http://jackson.codehaus.org/ .
0	Its an accepted thin wrapper that allows you to switch logging frameworks on application startup by switching jars on the runtime classpath.
1	You can try URL_http://openjpa.apache.org/jest.html [JEST] , it works over URL_http://openjpa.apache.org/ [OpenJPA] .
0	I am currently considering URL_http://code.google.com/p/redis/ [redis] + URL_http://code.google.com/p/jredis/ [jredis] One of my main motivations for this project is also to look into the programming model and ways of usage of NoSql DBs.
0	Rest clients for Java?
1	Below is an example of using this mechanism to leverage MOXy as the JSON provider.
1	I have added a hyperlink to my parser in my answer ( URL_http://www.softwaremonkey.org/Code/JsonParser) .
1	But it should not be limited to them.
1	Some channels (SocketChannel) support non-blocking IO, but this isnt true of all channels.
0	Here is a URL_http://www.holovaty.com/writing/headless-html-rendering- engine/ [link] to get you started, I am sure you can use Google to find out more information.
1	For instance to send a message: String CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	Quick and easy: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	In eclipse (and most IDEs) you can also use watch expressions to evaluate code running in the debugger.
0	Please fix your question to remove the vague and poorly- defined NoSQL and be more specific about what you want opinions on.
0	You might want to see the discussion about Swing vs. Qt URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/422956/java-swing-or-java-qt [here] .
1	 Option 1 Disable CODETERM1 (your second jboss-web.xml), bundle your Hibernate JARs into your app and add the following properties to your CODETERM2 (to avoid the issue youre facing): CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	 and Customizable**You can choose whether the GUI code should be generated with fully qualified or simple class names.
0	It is now located at: org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.internal.BasicFormatterImpl.
1	As far as I know they are focused on text-based output formats.
0	Please note, according to Java docs, the available() method might not work with InputStream but always works with BufferedInputStream.In case you dont want to use available() method we can always use the below code CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .
0	You could convert it to an array and then print that out with CODETERM1 : CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	It scales very well if I have to believe digg,facebook, twitter, etc.
0	Then to derive a good key from this information (in Java 6): CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	* I disagree.
0	Similar to the goal of Commons Logging, but more intuitive from my experience.
1	It is realy awesome, it helps you while writing the code.
1	The following is my understanding of the different frameworks, please correct me if im wrong.
1	I wouldnt recommend AWT, it gets very little love these days (other than the bits that are needed for Swing).
0	You can consider using memory-mapped files, via URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html [FileChannel] s .
1	Most NoSQL data stores dont support the concept of a composite primary key - and some of them wont allow you unique columns in the first place.
0	The context has to be initialized with the used classes, but you just have to specify the root classes and dont have to worry about static referenced classes.You use annotations to specify which classes should be elements (@XmlRootElement) and which fields are elements(@XmlElement) or attributes (@XmlAttribute, what a surprise!
1	Terracotta transparently clusters Java objects at the JVM level, and integrates with both Spring and Hibernate.
0	Also see: ( URL_http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/javadocs/api-2.4/o rg/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.html#toString%28java.io.InputStream,%20java.lang.
0	any ideas about performance of Scanner vs reading the stream in a more verbose way?
1	Props to Alex for bringing it up.
0	However, this has shrunk dramatically over the last several years due to more optimized JVMs, faster machines, and (I presume) optimization of the Swing internals.
1	I feel that it is potentially too much added complexity for the value it provides.
0	If SWT is missing a feature that you need, the framework is somewhat hostile to extending it.
1	Chained expressions like that are a pain to debug for NullPointerExceptions (and most other problems that can occur) so I would advise you to try and avoid it.
1	This tutorial page shows how to do what Ive mentioned URL_http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.0/13-restlet/21-restlet/318-restl et/303-restlet.html [here] .
1	CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	However, in August 2009, it was announced that the project would not be included due to an inability to reconcile design flaws and achieve consensus among the JSR 296 team before the milestone 5 deadline.
0	Could have been.
0	The former is for funneling to your desired logging framework (log4j, logback, etc), the latter is to replace the used logging framework.
0	so i dont suggest it.
1	I developed code in Java using AWT.
