How to trace a NullPointerException in a chain of getters.,[Documentation]
user/reference/views/breakpoints/ref-addexception_viewaction.htm [Here] is an explanation on how to add an exceptionbreakpoint in eclipse .,[Documentation]
You can set exception breakpoints in Eclipse as well.,[Documentation]
Fields dont play nicely with reflection.,[Documentation]
Getters and setters should be dumb if possible.,[Documentation]
"A getter is supposed to get the property, anything other than that and it is a side effect.",[Documentation]
"Changing a global variable, the state of an object or writing to a log is a side effect.",[Documentation]
"Now, highlight someObject and press CTRL+SHIFT+I (or right click and say inspect).",[uDocumentation]
"Its more about WHERE you break it up: Im talking about null checks at the beginning of constructors and methods before the actual logic of the code starts, so that youre not trying to break lines up in the MIDDLE of a method/piece of logic.",[Documentation]
Chained expressions like that are a pain to debug for NullPointerExceptions (and most other problems that can occur) so I would advise you to try and avoid it.,[Documentation]
In eclipse (and most IDEs) you can also use watch expressions to evaluate code running in the debugger.,[Documentation]
"We have some applications that sometimes get into a bad state, but only in production (of course!).",[Documentation]
"I tested this on a Windows box to prove that (1) the debugger port does not receive connections initially, and (2) throwing the TurnOnDebugger exception as shown above causes the debugger to come alive.","[Documentation, Community]"

"The question explicitly says the class is a built-in collection, so toString() cant be modified.",[Documentation]
One idea is URL_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet%5F%28programming%29 [Comet] .,[Documentation]
Those connections stay open until they time out or you send the client a message.,[Documentation]
This allows the server to (in effect) initiate communications.,[Documentation]

Then count the amount of bytes written instead of the amount of lines.,[Documentation]

"Yes, but this automatically generates a key ... but since I want to encrypt data between two places, I need to know the key beforehand, so I need to specify one instead of generate one.",[Documentation]
