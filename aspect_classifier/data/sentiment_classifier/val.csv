"ForGUI-intensive work, AWT feels very primitive to work with compared to Swing.Because Swing implements GUI functionality itself rather than relying on thehost OS, it can offer a richer environment on all platforms Java runs on.AWT is more limited in supplying the same functionality on all platformsbecause not all platforms implement the same-looking controls in the sameways.Swing components are called lightweight because they do not require anative OS object to implement their functionality.",1
