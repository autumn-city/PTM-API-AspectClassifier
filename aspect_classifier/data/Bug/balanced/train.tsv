0	Heres more-or-less sampaths answer, cleaned up a bit and represented as a function: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	3.
1	I havent used Java libraries that just do that entire work you describe, but its not that difficult to use ( URL_http://sourceforge.net/projects/javavis/ [ URL_http://sourceforge.net/projects/javavis/ ] ) as in the sample code described in the following paper: URL_http://imai-software.com/openlab/data/IMAI- JOUNALVI.pdf#page=43 [ URL_http://imai-software.com/openlab/data/IMAI - JOUNALVI.pdf#page=43] (see from page 43) - that paper is quite good and for its length :).
0	The problem was that when I the //do stuff runs, it takes a while, and it doesnt let me do anything else.
1	which java http client library is easy to use for programmatically doing posts, setting cookies and maybe ajax?
1	Hector is mavenized.
0	I have tried several other solutions, and this is the one I am sticking with.
1	You can use java.lang.system.out.println.
1	Java has progressed somewhat since the software Swing world.
1	There are 2 bug reports filed with Axis URL_https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS-2698 [AXIS-2698] URL_https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS-2749 [AXIS-2749] See also URL_https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS-1771 [AXIS-1771] , it has some interesting information regarding deserialization and ways to mediate its impact.
0	Why use a framework for RESTful services in Java instead of vanilla servlets.
0	Even 1.4 has hit its end of service life.
0	 SLF4j because its newer than Commons Logging and provides parameterized logging: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	Moreover, there is a huge amount of similarity between these logging frameworks resulting in duplication of effort, and confusion as to what logging environment you are actually in.
1	I guess this is 1990s and you are still using Netscape 4.0, right?
0	Isnt it required only for AES-192 or 256?
1	You could, setup a third business logic server that has a remote api which your two web apps could call.
1	Most (all) EE servers are anything but heavily concurrent, simply they are not.
0	Really easy to map JSON to almost any java object by only annotating the class using JsonElement and then passing the java and class to JsonReader like: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	Anyway, there are hundreds of alternatives in Java.
0	URL_http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/ [json-simple] was excellent: tiny, with a simple API that generates HashMap/ArrayList with a single call.
1	At what point is it better to switch from java.net to java.nio?
1	Unless your clients are real servers (in which case youre really the client), have them contact you and send a response to mimic push.
0	Im searching the java library for parsing XML (complex configuration and data files), I googled a bit but couldnt found other than dom4j (Seems like they are working on V2)..
1	The examples for the two modules - URL_http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-core-ga/examples.html [HttpCore] and URL_http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/examples.html [HttpClient] will get you started right away.
0	Youll have to write a lot of boiler plate code just to get a decent UI that feels modern.
0	below is the code i am using.. CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	Click into JLabels, JButtons, ButtonGroups, JTrees, JTextFields, ComboBoxes and edit their properties directly in place.
0	Related: URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2377467/if-swing-has-more - features-to-design-a-form-then-what-is-the-use-of-awt-in-java.
1	If you have a defined file layout with different content you should consider to use a template engine like URL_http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/ [FreeMarker] or URL_http://velocity.apache.org/ [Velocity] to generate your files.You can define templates here which will be filled with your dynamic content which you have to provide.
0	i want to create a Json like this CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	However, it doesnt work very well.
0	Note that the example above uses a simplified way to issue calls via the _ClientResource_ class.
0	;).
0	You can use URL_http://tomayac.de/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html [RestDescribe] to generate and compile WSDL, you can generate clients in php, ruby, python, java and C# using this.
0	Anyway, enough ranting, I wanted to see what kind of experiences people have had with other HTTP client libraries?
1	I know we can use the CODETERM1 method in Java get an individual character in a string by specifying its position.
0	JBossMQ may not scale as well as JBM, but to say not scalable at all is just plain wrong.
1	If a certain amount of delay (at minimum in the order of a few seconds) is acceptable, polling is less of an abuse of the HTTP protocol.
0	Thx.
1	Signup, 2.
1	Simply use the StringUtils class from URL_http://commons.apache.org/lang [apache-commons-lang] project.
1	The idea here is to keep an open connection to the server at all times that is just waiting for the server to do something with it.
0	In order to make your code work, I had to use this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream() (using Eclipse with a maven project).
1	Furthermore, as far as I understand, JIDE is flexible with regards to letting open source projects use their components in exchange for a link to their website or a logo in the About dialog.
0	The first rule of using a commercial tool is to assume the bug is in your code; not the commercial tool.
1	Ive also tried: CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .
0	Most providers dont have good support for the PBEwithand algorithms; for example, the SunJCE doesnt provide and PBE for AES.
1	EXE files are not text.
1	Check out URL_http://www.keyczar.org/ [keyczar] .
1	Well SLF4J is just a facade, like commons logging, which means they still need something else to work.
1	Please specify the encoding - its a very common bug.
1	Or use repeat(), which doesnt require the empty string at the start and is arguably clearer in intent (see my answer).
0	I learned this trick from URL_http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pat/archive/2004/10/stupid_scanner_1.html [Stupid-Scanner-tricks] article.
1	but Serialization will make it binary.
0	This is ridiculous.
1	 If your string can change (example: lots of logic and operations in the construction of the string) and will only be accessed from a single thread, using a CODETERM11 is good enough.
1	If you dont like RMI, Spring offers a few other remoting options - Hessian, Burlap, and HttpInvoker (Springs custom remoting solution - Java serialization over HTTP).
1	Yes it is still in use.
1	In fact, its not a matter of fine or not; its a matter of which is CORRECT.
1	2005 is not Jurassic period and I think you shouldnt dismiss a library (in Java, at least) because it hasnt been updated for 5 years.
0	 You use URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuffer.html [CODETERM4] in the same circumstances you would use CODETERM5 , but when changes to the underlying string must be synchronized (because several threads are reading/modifyind the string buffer).
0	On our MQ system we have an average of 3.5 threads per subscriber.Having 300 users served that makes 1000 threads just for MQ.
1	Fields dont play nicely with reflection because most reflection apis are built upon a property inspection methodology that conforms to the Javabean contract.
0	And JXTA supports it too but the configuration is complicated.
1	I am making the exact same decision at the moment, and Swing is my candidate, simply for the fact that it is the most mature, yet realistic option available.
1	OAuth2 is a great approach to ensure that each logged in user receives their own access token that you can track and manage.
1	@plasma147 Instead of downvoting, consider editing the example (I just submitted that, adding Closeables.closeQuietly(stream);).
0	Very powerful, widely used and accepted.
0	Also it doesnt specify the mode; read Wikipedias Block Cipher Modes of Operation for concerns.
0	About hiding the underlying implementation: All the logging APIs mentioned can do just that: They are interfaces to pluggable implementations.
0	GlassFish is friendlier for developers.
0	Im not saying it is bad.. but there may be other libraries which are worth noticing :).
1	excellent trick!
0	Same is actually true for JAXB reference implementation, not much activity for past couple of years.
1	However on the client side there seems to be something missing that is comparable to Apache Axis for SOAP - something that hides the web service and marshals the data transparently back to Java objects.
1	Few people develop in AWT anymore.
0	(I thought I would use log4j directly, but that was before I learned a little bit more about logging and a lot of respectable libraries seem to choose the path of a bridge/facade for their logging needs.
1	But some are slow, some are buggy, some are incomplete.
1	At the moment I manually start 3 downloader threads which each download 1/3 of the file.
0	Upvoting you just in case it does help someone else, too late for me Im afraid :).
1	My first impression was a nice one.
0	thanks a lot skiphoppy...
1	Some of the links I found prior to posting.
1	Just ran a quick test: fetching from localhost, very small document (150 bytes) x 5000 times takes roughly 10 seconds with HttpClient (4.1) and under 2 seconds with HUC.
1	The URL_http://www.hoozi.com/Articles/AESEncryption.htm [algorithm] is simple.
1	Set a very large socket receive buffer.
1	A more direct comparison for JBoss 5 would be the GlassFish v2 releases, which are based on Java EE 5.

1	Behind the scenes you can then plugin whatever f/w you desire as mentioned by Travis.
0	A lot of overhead is wasted converting from String to StringBuffer and then back to String again.
0	CODETERM7 / CODETERM8 should always involve CODETERM9 s (at least for XML) 3. i really don see a good reason to arbitrarily remove a piece of a date representation.
1	And <strike> CODETERM1 Reference: URL_http://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/system.string.chars%28v=VS.71%29.aspx [ URL_http://msdn.microsoft.com /en-us/library/system.string.chars%28v=VS.71%29.aspx] </strike> The above is same as using indexers in c#.
1	I especially like being able to switch back and forth between using a tree model (similar to XML DOM) and object mapping.
1	That is, do use methods that depend on the platform default encoding.
0	The whole API felt really complex and a bit esoteric at times.
1	I can get access to the HttpServlet Request object in a soap web service as follows:Declaring a private field for the WebServiceContext in the service implementation, and annotate it as a resource: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	I question how often we put effort into optimizing something that no one notices.
1	CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	FWIW, I would choose Swing with my own home-made Guts-GUI framework :-).
1	So for simple cases there is no benefit of declaring your own.
0	Youll need to dig around to really see it working since this project is not designed as a demo as such and is very much a work in progress.
0	Thanks.
0	The XStream library also supports JSON: URL_http://xstream.codehaus.org/json- tutorial.html [ URL_http://xstream.codehaus.org/json-tutorial.html ] .
0	Next releases will support clustering and partitioning Apache 2 license: free for any use Much more .
0	And then I can use that token to authorize the user?
1	It looks like it uses reflection on bean-style properties and uses similar rules as Hibernate/JPA lazy-loading for serialization, so if you give it an object to serialize it will leave out collections (unless you tell it to include them) so you dont end up serializing the entire object graph.
1	You can find that link also from URL_http://www.schneier.com /blowfish-download.html [Bruce-Schneiers-website] (the creator of both algorithms).
1	You do this bu selecting the code and use the contet menu to add a new watch.
0	Meanwhile we can dream of URL_http://groovy.codehaus.org/Operators#Operators- SafeNavigationOperator(%3F.
1	Well you can program it for yourself.. its not complicated.. CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	What I really like about Spring Security is once it is set up the security is integrated into the project seamlessly.
1	For instance, you may want to look at JavaFX if you need a rich UI; or using SWT in your application.
1	Also dont forget about CODETERM32 when building fixed formatted output, which can be optimized by the compiler as they make it better.
0	An exception that the property is null is a side-effect of invoking the getter, because it is something that occurred within the getter method invocation that forces the caller to adapt to its effects directly, instead of indirectly via a null check.
0	All you do is annotate a POJO with JAXB annotations and include the proper libraries.
1	If you can, run the application under Java 6.
0	And yet another example is here: URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2496494 /library-to-encode-decode-from-json-to-java-util-map/2496528#2496528.
0	No real need to close the BufferedReader/InputStreamReader as theyre only wrapping the stream +1 !!

1	I would use Commons Logging if I was enhancing something that already used it.
0	I have a system where Im being fed strings from which I need to (on a best guess basis) remove URLs, anything which might be HTML and anything which might be a date - Ive found Natty is excellent for the latter, but Ive built exceptions for April, May and June, which are valid girls names.
1	FOR THE LOVE OF GOD YES!
1	Isnt there a reader.close() missing?
0	Were still not quite there, but we have tried a few things now and see things more clearly.
0	 Basics:** CODETERM1 is an immutable class, it cant be changed.
0	The most complicated part is using, for example, the layouts (If you can not handle complicated parts), but everything is almost plug & play.
1	Its both a library you can use and a data extraction tool, which sounds to me thats exactly what you want to do.
0	JFormDesigner.
1	You can then analyze the heap dump with the _jhat_ tool (it comes with your JDK).
0	It is pretty convenient for a lot of cases.
0	I dont think theres any framework out there that does that out of the box.
1	If you write it yourself, it will probably be non-standard and you will have to maintain it yourself.

0	To implement a progress bar correctly you will need to create your own implementation of a URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingWorker.html [CODETERM4] .
1	I have no personal experience with the following approach,but it could make sense to consider: URL_http://xstream.codehaus.org/index.html [XStream] (xml <-> java data binding) with URL_http://jettison.codehaus.org/ [Jettison] driver (xml<->json mapper), more details are available URL_http://xstream.codehaus.org/json- tutorial.html [here] .

1	Once again, these are my findings and your findings may not be exactly the same, but I wrote this to give some indication to others of the efficiency differences of these approaches.
0	Otherwise, you are encoding and decoding needlessly.
1	Second, enabling jasypt is a non-goal.
0	CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	Your first criteria might be a little bit subjective.
0	This may not be a satisfactory answer to your question, still: You might want to evaluate existing service providers for the task and either include their product or integrate one via web services.
1	AppFuse tries to do this, but it aims more at allowing you many different choices when it comes to web frameworks.
1	The whole point of using InputStream is, that a) you dont know the length of the _complete_ stream (which bails out anything depending on available) and b) the stream can be anything - a file, a socket, something internal (which bails out anything based on File.size()).
1	Although Oracle has much reduced the work on Swing (apparently, seen from an outsider), the new Swing JavaFX (I dont like this way to call it actually because it has almost no commonalities with Swing) is, from my point of view, not ready yet for primetime.
1	_It seems like I should just stick with old log4j ( CODETERM1 ) as it is the lowest common denominator?_ on further examination of log4j 2.0 while very similar it appears the configuration is not backward compatible with log4j 1.2.
1	Secure Debugging for Production JVMs.
1	Its where the Cipher class is defined.
1	The byte length depends on the character encoding used.
1	From the CODETERM5 javadoc (and is repeated in the respective CODETERM6 methods from the other classes): _The contents of the character array are copied; subsequent modification of the character array does not affect the newly created string._ So youll end up having a possibly big memory copy operation after the fast filling of the array.

0	The longer the delay is the less connections you have to open.
1	In this string every JSON object contains an array of other JSON objects.
0	The question close nannies strike again!.
1	And are you willing to use any libraries at all, such as machine learning?
0	Even if you are not interested in reading XML/HTML/MS DOC formats you can just specify text/plain.
0	I dont envision any external apps using the API for data.
1	You could argue that Swing was good to begin with but we all know that code rots.
0	You feed the grammar to ANTLR, which spits out the lexer/parser classes that youll then compile and run.
1	Also beware of initializing a CODETERM19 with a CODETERM20 as that will only allocated the size of the String + 16 characters, which in most cases will just start the degenerate re-allocation and copy cycle that you are trying to avoid.

1	+1 Base your development on Swing.
0	 Performance: Swing components are generally slower and buggier than AWT, due to both the fact that they are pure Java and to video issues on various platforms.
0	Im not feeling confident with a UI framework that tries so hard to hide the documentation from potential new fans.
0	You have full syntax autocomplete which speeds up your query-writing and makes it more error-prone.
1	So its an O(1) operation (no loop) and it saves memory (if that is a real issue).
1	@David: Good catch.
0	Alternatively, you can use the _jconsole_ tool (which also comes with your JDK) to request a heap dump at any time using the memory management MBeans.
