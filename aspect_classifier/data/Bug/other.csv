Why the hell has Ceki created 3 logging frameworks!!!,[Bug]
 Commons Logging because you dont want to lock down to a particular logging framework (so instead you lock down to what Commons Logging gives you instead) - I dont think it is sensible to decide using this point as the reason.,[Bug]
SLF4j FTW!Also thanks to Ken G for pointing out that SLF4j is written by the same guy as log4j.,[Bug]

"Or use repeat(), which doesnt require the empty string at the start and is arguably clearer in intent (see my answer).",[Bug]
What is wrong?,[Bug]
From the CODETERM5 javadoc (and is repeated in the respective CODETERM6 methods from the other classes): _The contents of the character array are copied; subsequent modification of the character array does not affect the newly created string._ So youll end up having a possibly big memory copy operation after the fast filling of the array.,[Bug]
So its an O(1) operation (no loop) and it saves memory (if that is a real issue).,[Bug]
I know we can use the CODETERM1 method in Java get an individual character in a string by specifying its position.,[Bug]
And <strike> CODETERM1 Reference: URL_http://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/system.string.chars%28v=VS.71%29.aspx [ URL_http://msdn.microsoft.com /en-us/library/system.string.chars%28v=VS.71%29.aspx] </strike> The above is same as using indexers in c#.,[Bug]

"Also beware of initializing a CODETERM19 with a CODETERM20 as that will only allocated the size of the String + 16 characters, which in most cases will just start the degenerate re-allocation and copy cycle that you are trying to avoid.",[Bug]

"The whole point of using InputStream is, that a) you dont know the length of the _complete_ stream (which bails out anything depending on available) and b) the stream can be anything - a file, a socket, something internal (which bails out anything based on File.size()).",[Bug]
