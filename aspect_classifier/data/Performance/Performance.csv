The big annoyance in switching is actually the configuration and supported appenders.,[Performance]
) but how can I programmatical-ly turn off or change the threshold of a specific appender during runtime?,[uPerformance]
"The Log4J2 website reports that there is an adapter for SLF4J, so if you write your code to SLF4J you can switch to Log4J, Log4J2, and Logback whenever you want.",[Performance]
"Id suggest using slf4j, since it can use log4j as a backend if thats what you need.",[Performance]
Why one would use one of the following packages instead of the other?,[Performance]
" Logback because its newer than log4j and again, supports parameterized logging, as it implements SLF4j directly SLF4j/Logback because its written by the same guy who did log4j, so hes made it better (according to URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/354837/whats-up-with-logging-in-java#356038 [Ken-G] - thanks.",[Performance]
"Apache commons is meant to bridge different logging frameworks, but really just adds more complexity.",[Performance]
"If you do not know this ahead of time, it is utterly bewildering.","[Performance, Usability]"
Is this an answer?,"[Performance, Usability]"
This can be incredibly useful if you put stuff like the username and the URL of the request (in case of a webapp) into it.,[Performance]
"Technically, its a thread-local Map<string,string>.",[Performance]
In our company project we use LOG4j and it is very easy to use like Stephen showed in his example.We also have written our own pattern classes for LOG4j so you can create your own output file schemas.,[Performance]
You can describe how your log file should look like.,[uPerformance]
Its an accepted thin wrapper that allows you to switch logging frameworks on application startup by switching jars on the runtime classpath.,[Performance]
+1 - thats exactly what he was looking for (aka cool).,"[Performance, OnlySentiment]"
"Luckily I am already using this jar, so i could use this straight away.",[Performance]
" Difference:** CODETERM1 is if you try to alter their values, another object gets created, whereas CODETERM2 and CODETERM3 are so they can change their values.",[Performance]
 Difference:** The difference between CODETERM4 and CODETERM5 is that CODETERM6 is thread-safe.,"[Performance, Usability]"
" You use URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html [CODETERM3] when you need to create a mutable character sequence, usually to concatenate several character sequences together.","[Performance, Usability]"
"Furthermore, your example of a + b would be compiled into a single literal ab but if you used StringBuilder it would result in two needless calls to append().",[Performance]
Only if profiling told me it made a difference would I do it your way.,[Performance]
"Note that if you are using Java 5 or newer, you should use CODETERM1 instead of CODETERM2 .",[Performance]
"Yeah, it really shouldnt require so much boilerplate to do something as simple as read strings from a stream.",[Performance]
@Ronald: Erm... never mind that.,[Performance]
The problem with this approach I find is it does not handle CR/LF translations too well.,[Performance]
"@ArchimedesTrajano does IOUtils.copy(inputStream, writer, encoding) deal with CR/LF translations better?","[Performance, Usability]"
any ideas about performance of Scanner vs reading the stream in a more verbose way?,[Performance]
"If you do, gist it and Ill append your results to the answer.",[Performance]
"You really, should be using IOUtils.copy(inputStream, writer, encoding); unless you really, know what youre doing, which people never do with character encoding related programming.",[Performance]
@Per Wiklander I disagree with you.,[Performance]
To save anyone the hassle of Googling - org.apache.commons commons-io 1.3.2 .,[Performance]
"Also little improvement would be to use apache io (or other) constant for character encoding instead of using plain string literal - eg: IOUtils.toString(myInputStream, Charsets.UTF_8);.",[Performance]
Taking into account file one should first get a CODETERM1 instance.,[Performance]
"This can then be read and added to a CODETERM2 (we dont need CODETERM3 if we are not accessing it in multiple threads, and CODETERM4 is faster).",[Performance]
"@jmort253 Many libraries are large, slow but powerful.",[Performance]
Thank you for indicating that there are times when this is necessary.,[Performance]
"If this would be the only use of the library, it would be overkill to use the library.",[Performance]
"On the other hand, determining your own buffer size(s) you can tune your memory/processor usage balance.",[Performance]
"The thing is, youre first splitting into lines, and then undoing that.",[Performance]
"Also, readLine does not distinguish between n and r, so you cannot reproduce the exact stream again.",[Performance]
Note that the second parameter (i.e.,[Performance]
eg.,"[Performance, Usability]"
"For example, if youre getting the body of an HTTP request via its just request.getReader() )**.",[Performance]
Thanks @trnl.,[Performance]

"First ,you have to know the encoding of string that you want to convert.Because the java.io.InputStream operates an underlying array of bytes,however,a string is composed by a array of character that needs an encoding, e,g.",[Performance]
