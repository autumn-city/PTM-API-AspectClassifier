1	 Option 2 Disable CODETERM3 (your second jboss-web.xml), bundle your Hibernate JARs into your app and override the hibernate-validator JARs CODETERM4 
0	Without salts, a dictionary attack could be used, enabling a pre-computed list of the most likely symmetric encryption keys.
0	Youve found your NPE.
0	Yes, you did : ).
1	You really, should be using IOUtils.copy(inputStream, writer, encoding); unless you really, know what youre doing, which people never do with character encoding related programming.
0	 Look and Feel: AWT components more closely reflect the look and feel of the OS they run on.
1	If you have a method or constructor that takes an object parameter and the object/method in question cannot sensibly deal with that parameter being null, then just check and throw a NullPointerException there and then.
1	Thanks!
0	Once you have done this, and using the sample code supplied with the Bountycastle package you should be able to encrypt your data.
0	This essentially means that FileChannel#map is, in general, unusable.
0	 Vendor Support: Swing development is more active.
1	Does anyone have a better/different way to read a file into a string in Java?
0	At the time, circa early 2000s the sweet spot seemed to be about 10 K; it might be a little larger now, but probably not by much.
0	(shown below) I left out try/catch blocks for the sake readability.
1	I know its Java, and were not into the whole brevity thing, but thats a little much.
1	Frameworks like Qt and SWT need native DLLs.
0	If you do, gist it and Ill append your results to the answer.
0	I know many developers would like to have this.
1	@Per Wiklander I disagree with you.
0	 by Oscar Reyes** This is the (simplified) underlying code on the cited library: CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .
0	How else ?
0	When implemented correctly, applets like any client-side security scheme will increase the security posture of an application.
1	For example, if youre getting the body of an HTTP request via its just request.getReader() )**.
1	Is this an answer?
0	 What?
0	Promising.
0	You dont need an external library for parsing XML in Java.
1	Is that not an option?
0	I can specify a 16bit one which works for 128bit encryption which works.
0	I know that Wicket and Hibernate uses Simple Logging Facade for Java ( URL_http://www.slf4j.org/ [SL4J] ) and that Spring is using the URL_http://commons.apache.org/logging/ [logging-component-from-Apache-Commons] .
1	 URL_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_AWT [AWT] Is the very foundation of swing, it performs well but is lacking in advanced components.
0	Related: URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2377467/if-swing-has-more - features-to-design-a-form-then-what-is-the-use-of-awt-in-java.
1	This API is backed by the Restlet Engine and both are now shipped in a single JAR (_org.restlet.jar_).
1	If you want to actually do something with the resulting parsed grammar, I might suggest looking at URL_http://db.apache.org/derby/ [Derby] , an open source SQL database written in Java.
0	So far, I had a great experience with the community wiki and documentation of Jboss, and it pretty much covers everything.
0	You are welcome to use whatever library that suits your needs best.
0	To get a progress bar to show up on a form only involves dropping it onto a CODETERM2 and perhaps setting CODETERM3 so hat it shows that your program is working.

0	I can see from the task manager that the javaw process is still doing small IO writes, but I dont really know why this happens (Im guessing race conditions?).
1	JAAS is a security framework build for securing things at a much lower level then web-application.
1	Any suggestions would be helpful.
0	JAXB 2.0 also has support for JSON serialization using Jettison.
1	Also a bit of a clunker to start with but really handy when youre comfortable .
1	Yeah, it really shouldnt require so much boilerplate to do something as simple as read strings from a stream.
1	This method requires Java 6.
1	Doesnt it offer DOM manipulation?
1	First, that would be DES encryption, not AES.
0	However, it doesnt work very well.
0	Sometimes speed is of the utmost importance and is a hard requirement.
0	@mP.
0	@Thimmayya: Then dont use NoSQL -- its too vague to have any meaning.
0	I dont envision any external apps using the API for data.
1	After a couple of screens and a little research I am just as productive.
1	 awt componentsare heavy weight.
1	Things that seem like they should be simple are taking hundreds of lines of code (and Im _still_ not sure resources get cleaned up correctly).
1	@Troelsen yes correct!.
1	The only time HttpComponents code turned out significantly more complicated was for parsing dates from a header.
1	Be aware when using CODETERM1 the returned integer does not have to represent the actual file size, but rather the guessed amount of bytes the system should be able to read from the stream without blocking IO.
1	Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable]( URL_http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/8259 ) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference.
1	The requests consist of the incoming rather small request (proper SOAP) and the returning result packet that is essentially one long SOAP string (and the contents of the string are XML).
0	First, we tried to look at how the business layer alone could be exposed to other web apps, and Spring offers JMX wrapping at the price of a tiny amount of XML.
1	The default size of the buffer is 1024, but Scanner will increase the size as necessary (see Scanner#makeSpace()).
1	Rhino print function.
0	If I were in your shoes, Id go with this option just because I know that it would show great performance, there are mature tools for working with MySql, many people have experience with it and at any time you can easily use all its relational potential if you eventually decide to go back to RDBMS solutions.
0	Did help.
1	AWT might however look somewhat ugly on some operating systems.
1	The example uses the UTF-8 encoding that allows expression of the full unicode range (Including Chinese).
0	Setting this up is easy -- one need only add this to his command line: -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=PORT There seems to be no available security mechanism, so turning on debugging in production would effectively allow arbitrary code execution (via hotswap).
0	Downvoting as doesnt close inputstream.
1	Stop the madness.
0	Systems can easily have multiple Java runtimes; double- check to make sure that the correct location is being used.
1	And as a personal comment, Looks very interesting!
0	If you need a native, pure Java solution, that leaves you with the rest.

0	Why?
0	thanks, updated the link.
0	For example, 2 wednesdays from now cant be parsed by any other solution Ive found.
1	Thanks.
1	Printing Java collections nicely (toString doesnt return pretty output).
1	You can refactor, for example, into CODETERM1 which calls CODETERM2 which calls CODETERM3 which calls CODETERM4 .
0	Any serious Java UI work is done in Swing not AWT, which was primarily used for applets.

1	Its a ground-up redesign, and is probably a better option for you.
1	3.
0	+1, concise answer.
1	To save anyone the hassle of Googling - org.apache.commons commons-io 1.3.2 .
1	I can only give you my (biased) perspective.
0	There may be a much better/easier solution, but I would do the following: 1.
0	In many ways, a ReadableByteChannel is like an InputStream, and WritableByteChannel is like an OutputStream.
1	We used it in one of our project to replace the plain old java-serialization and it worked almost out of the box.
1	That at least reduces your exposure to someone who can get a process into the server, or someone who can crack your SSL.
0	And are you willing to use any libraries at all, such as machine learning?
1	JBoss Messaging is now in bug fix mode only, since JBoss / Red Hat has a new Java messaging project called HornetQ.
0	Its very cool, very great, but the second you want to do anything other than simple objects, you could easily need to start building your own serializers (which isnt _that_ hard).
0	Way to jump on the people trying to help you, dude.
1	@jmort253 Many libraries are large, slow but powerful.
1	So as a rule of thumb you are not supposed to use DES or its variants because it is being phased out.
1	Thank you for indicating that there are times when this is necessary.
1	If this would be the only use of the library, it would be overkill to use the library.
0	I have tried several other solutions, and this is the one I am sticking with.
1	What better way to open my account on the site.
1	It will be good if you go for latest version release.
1	This also allows me to easily test my UI with automated JUnit tests (because I can control what the source looks like).
0	I find jackson or simple json much easier to use then gson.
1	You can describe how your log file should look like.
0	There might be some simple task like re- ordering a variable initialization and its use or re-naming a variable (this was especially a problem when using Matisses database feature).
1	You should use PBKDF 2 specified in PKCS#5.
0	Microsoft?
1	Configure the backend to log all categories to one file, and youre done.
1	The Log4J2 website reports that there is an adapter for SLF4J, so if you write your code to SLF4J you can switch to Log4J, Log4J2, and Logback whenever you want.
0	This one fails for empty files with a java.util.NoSuchElementException.
1	Youll have to write a lot of boiler plate code just to get a decent UI that feels modern.
0	AWTis a thin layer of code on top of the OS, whereas Swing is much larger.Swing also has very much richer functionality.
1	I use ACL + log4j.
1	I mean does it save time?
1	One Line Solution CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	The current state of the MDC is attached to every event.

1	@jmort253 Many libraries are large, slow but powerful.
0	On the other hand, determining your own buffer size(s) you can tune your memory/processor usage balance.
1	To allow sending files between both computers, each computer will need to run the server (receiving code) to listen for incoming files, and they will both need to run the sending code when they want to send a file.
1	Heres a way using only standard Java library (note that the stream is not closed, YMMV).
1	I think that will be good.
0	I cant believe they can fix it, and I still cant believe mixing lightweight and heavyweight components would ever be desirable.
0	I think I vaguely remember seeing that in the logback project but I need one for the XML format.
1	 - then you just call lc.login(); and authenticate the credentials.
0	but for the 98% case, I think its pretty solid.
0	It can greatly help in migrating log4j.properties to logback.xml.
1	@Ronald: Erm... never mind that.
1	The second you start using Shiro though, you just get it.
0	If you want the file read by 3rd party as well, how about using some popular existing exchange format such as CSV or XML?
0	Both are quite good but I prefer the latter.
1	This can then be read and added to a CODETERM2 (we dont need CODETERM3 if we are not accessing it in multiple threads, and CODETERM4 is faster).
1	ill update the text.
1	Apache commons is meant to bridge different logging frameworks, but really just adds more complexity.
0	One should always strive to slot a level of interdirection and hide an implementation even if it is clogging with your own logging.
1	If you know what technology you are going to use, having a startup app that is customized for your needs can be a huge timesaver.
1	Thanks!

0	It can parse JSON to Maps and Lists faster than any other lib can parse to a JSON DOM and that is without Index Overlay mode.
1	Yeah, it really shouldnt require so much boilerplate to do something as simple as read strings from a stream.
1	Can you please clarify what null checks you would use in this case before the changed getters of someObject?

1	The big annoyance in switching is actually the configuration and supported appenders.
0	PlayOrm is another solution which is JPA-like but with noSQL specific features like you can do @NoSqlEmbedded on a List of Strings and it is embedded in that row leading to a table where each row is a different length than the other rows...this is a noSql common pattern which is why NoSql ORMs need a slight break from JPA.
1	The whole point of using InputStream is, that a) you dont know the length of the _complete_ stream (which bails out anything depending on available) and b) the stream can be anything - a file, a socket, something internal (which bails out anything based on File.size()).
1	You dont just want to extract parameters.
1	For most NoSQL engines youll probably want an id there, too, just for efficiencys sake.
0	From my understanding, NIO is meant for one server, many clients, but what Im thinking of is one client, many servers.
1	Thanks @trnl.
1	Will they co-exist happily?I thought I would use URL_http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html [log4j] together with both SL4J and the logging component from Apache commons, do you think thats a good idea?
