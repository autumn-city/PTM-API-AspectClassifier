0	user268098: I think most Java JSON handling libraries have issues with cyclic dependencies, and most have some ways to either exclude just references, or handle them with annotations (I added an answer in the other question to point out one way to do that with Jackson).

1	CODETERM8 is more efficient than CODETERM9 .
0	This doesnt make any sense.
0	logj4 might not be your best bet, if you need highly concurrent logging you should go w/ just something like a concurrent linked queue (or blocking) and a dedicated polling thread.
1	The example uses the UTF-8 encoding that allows expression of the full unicode range (Including Chinese).
1	Only if collection contains user defined objects , then you need to implement toString() in user defined class to display content.
1	Scott, isnt the link in the comment just above yours enough for you?
1	Does someone have different (i.e.
0	My idea was to have write a sever app on each machine that acts as a gateway from the control center to the radio hardware, with one socket for each unit.
0	The other option is SWT together with the Eclipse RCP, but its harder (though not impossible) to integrate pure Swing components into such an application.
1	Well played, and to save the next guy the Googling, [Paths is apparently 1.7+]( URL_http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Paths.html ) as is [FileSystems]( URL_http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSys tems.html).

0	Sure, they have done things to reduce complexity, like creating custom XML namespaces to reduce the quantity of XML configuration, but for me, these dont address _my_ personal fundamental issue with Spring Security: its names and concepts are often confusing in general to me.
0	Other users have provide some very useful links above so I am not going to bother with links.
0	I am not sure if there will be any encoding issues.
0	which features do they have?

1	It will tell you what those 4 million objects actually contain which might give you insight into why the software isnt releasing that memory.
0	 Would it not be easier (for future developers) and faster (to implement and learn) to map the url pattern CODETERM1 to a servlet and have a line or two that parses the url for the parameters instead of learning, implementing and configuring one of these libraries to do it for you.
1	The rest is fluff that I dont care about (maybe returned by some REST API).
1	There is a much smaller set of AWT components available, thus placing the burden on the programmer to create his or her own AWT-based components.
1	This solution uses multibyte characters.
1	Its not completely thread safe (atleast AES engine).
1	For example, lets say I have the following JSON: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	I suggest you generate your serialization (if you need to have the afstest possible speed) or use reflections to do the translation.
0	The best known are URL_http://nekohtml.sourceforge.net/ [NekoHTML] and URL_http://jtidy.sourceforge.net/ [JTidy] .

0	I would like to suggest another framework: Apache Pivot URL_http://pivot.apache.org/ [ URL_http://pivot.apache.org/ ] .
0	From the API documentation: As of release JDK 5, this class has been supplemented with an equivalent class designed for use by a single thread, CODETERM3 .
0	But this can be an involved process.
0	Once were at the finish line, there is no one there to congratulate us.
1	Of course, you could choose other character encodings besides UTF-8.
1	Is there a good open-source Java library for parsing SQL statements?
0	Much appreciated.
0	URL_http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~sam/simmetrics.html [SimMetrics] URL_http://ngramj.sourceforge.net/ [NGramJ] .
1	plz update it...
1	Its based on a grammar and JavaCC, so probably a better option than reinventing this wheel with antlr in any event.
0	First ,you have to know the encoding of string that you want to convert.Because the java.io.InputStream operates an underlying array of bytes,however,a string is composed by a array of character that needs an encoding, e,g.
1	Not that HttpUrlConnection is a bad choice, HttpComponents will abstract a lot of the tedious coding away.
1	I thing that we both agree that this method isnt thread-safe in many ways.
0	The connection is long lived, server squirts up data periodically, browser thread sucks that data and displays it.
0	Additionally the client interface to the DB is a pleasure to work with.
