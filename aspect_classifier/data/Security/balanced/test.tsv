1	Maybe Im doing something wrong, this isnt exactly rigorous benchmarking.
1	Most java json libs do not deal with cyclic deps -- thats more domain of object serialization frameworks.
0	For example, Restlet can easily work with remote resources using its HTTP client connector.

1	Problems with web.xml creating a HTTP Status 500 error - The server encountered an internal error () that prevented it from fulfilling this request , the tutorial says: Create a new Servlet Web application as usual, add a com.firstStepsServlet package and put the resource and application classes in.
0	Lastly, all these logging frameworks are WAY TOO COMPLICATED.
0	I attempted to get the response into a String 3 different ways.
1	A side effect is an action that changes something outside of a method.
0	Maybe in a later version of the app it will be removed for a faster solution.

0	Yes, but this automatically generates a key ... but since I want to encrypt data between two places, I need to know the key beforehand, so I need to specify one instead of generate one.
