@Shayan So what?,[Security]
Which is the best library for XML parsing in java.,[Security]
Both are wrappers of the SAX and DOM parsers built into the JDK.,[Security]
The only drawback I noticed is that I cant create objects id on my own for cross referencing.,[Security]

A side effect is an action that changes something outside of a method.,[Security]

"I need a simple application, preferably a cross-platform one, that enables sending of files between two computers.",[Security]
You can write one by using Socket programming in Java.,[Security]
You would need to write a Server and a Client program.,[Security]
So the replacement code needs to to adapted in order to fit in his solution.,"[Security, Usability]"
The exact solution will depend on the DB used.,[Security]
"Also, a common mis-perception is that nio is _faster_ than io.",[Security]
The article describes various approaches.,[Security]
Dont use read without arguments.Its very slow.Better read it to buffer and move it to file quickly.,[Security]
"Assuming some single-byte encoding, it will (temporarily) require 5 bytes of memory for each character in the file.","[Security, Usability]"
And they have a well-defined structure.,"[Security, Community]"
The file is always closed.,[Security]
"Also note you can read anything that is Readable , like Files, InputStreams, channels...I sometimes use this code to read from the display window of eclipse, when Im not sure if Im reading one file or another...yes, classpath confuses me.","[Security, Performance]"
"As the poster, I can say I really dont know if and when the file is properly close...I never write this one in production code, I use it only for tests or debug.",[Security]
"The code in the answer isnt the actual, current Guava source.",[Security]
Java is high level compared with C but low compared with Python or Ruby.,[Security]
Where is the difference?,[Security]
There is also a newer algorithm by the same guy called URL_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twofish [Twofish] .,[Security]
"I need to implement 256 bit AES encryption, but all the examples I have found online use a KeyGenerator to generate a 256 bit key, but I would like to use my own passkey.","[Security, Usability]"
"I got both .NET and Java to compile something in what I thought was 256bit, but the results were different.",[Security]
"The recipient generates a CODETERM8 in exactly the same way, using the same salt and password.",[Security]
Systems can easily have multiple Java runtimes; double- check to make sure that the correct location is being used.,[Security]

"in the database, why not just use PBEWithMD5AndDES and append the salt to the encrypted text, after loading u can strip the salt and use it for decryption.",[Security]
"First, that would be DES encryption, not AES.","[Security, Performance]"
A package that purports to offer security without requiring an understanding of the underlying principles seems dangerous prima facie.,[Security]
"@erickson Im new here, not sure how this works but would you be interested in bounty points to fix up Dougs code?",[Security]
Feel free to edit to make it better.,[Security]
The salt is used to prevent dictionary attacks against the key in the event your encrypted data is compromised.,[Security]
I would like to use named entity recognition (NER) to find adequate tags for texts in a database.,"[Security, Usability]"

SimMetrics is probably what you need: URL_http://sourceforge.net/projects/simmetrics/ [ URL_http://sourceforge.net/projects/simmetrics/ ] It has several algorithms for calculating various flavours of edit-distance.,[Security]

Would you like to say something about when it is good to move from container based security to alternatives like shiro or others?,[Security]
It allows to expose Spring beans remotely using simple annotations in the latest versions.,[Security]
"The other option is to use some form of shared cache architecture... which will synchronize object changes between the servers, but you still have two sets of instances.",[Security]
Take a look at URL_http://www.jboss.org/jbosscache/ [JBossCache] .,[Security]
"Since simple flat files require no setup and dont use SQL, what are you asking?",[Security]
From JPA to NOSQL.,[Security]
"The entity I want to add, was befored modeled without NOSQL in this way: Triple.java CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .",[Security]
"I am omiting repetitions, but the 3 CODETERM1 s are part of the primary key, of the @Id.",[Security]
"Now the question, which actually are two questions: A) CODETERM2 gives me error on Eclipse, and advises me to add a cast, but this doesnt solve the error.",[Security]
"JPA modelling is ok, but I dont know how to do the same in NOSQL .",[Security]
This could be easily modelled with Spring Data Graph (or also with the pure Neo4j API) CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .,"[Security, Usability]"

Short of dropping the API altogether (and using just session/cookies) its still the best and most scalable approach.,[Security]
"Of course, there are a few working solutions, e.g.",[Security]

- You can take an iris snap from you camera phone.,[Security]
You can use the CODETERM2 annotation to flag other types (such as ServletContext or the HttpServletRequest specifically).,[Security]
You dont just want to extract parameters.,"[Security, Performance]"
i agree that we can do the same thing by implementing servlets and then parse the url and then implement the basic logic.,[Security]
use of annotations) it is not convoluted to get to the values of parameters (e.g.,[Security]
"Problems with web.xml creating a HTTP Status 500 error - The server encountered an internal error () that prevented it from fulfilling this request , the tutorial says: Create a new Servlet Web application as usual, add a com.firstStepsServlet package and put the resource and application classes in.","[Security, Usability]"

Funnily enough I have just ordered RESTful Web Services on Amazon before I read your post.,[Security]

@mKorbel Netbeans editor works just fine with plain Swing applications.,[Security]
My vote is for Netbeans visual editor.,[Security]

well its not worth a -1 vote ;P But something to ponder about.,"[Security, Others]"
The thin wrapper eliminates the need for another jar being packaged and is not as much as reinventing.,[Security]

"Example: In Java, you would say str.charAt(8);In C#, you would say str[8]; .",[Security]
This can result in large amounts of RAM getting allocated and not used when CODETERM10 classes start to grow large.,[Security]
Any good implementation will use a StringBuilder behind the scenes as you say.,[Security]

There is no optional case: either one or (more likely) the other is correct.,[Security]
