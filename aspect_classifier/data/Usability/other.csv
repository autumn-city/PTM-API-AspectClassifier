What is the difference between swing and awt?,[Usability]
Can some one please explain me what is the difference between swing and awt?,[Usability]
Are there any cases where awt is more useful/ advised to use then swing or vice-versa?,[Usability]
AWT is a Java interface to native system GUI code present in your OS.,[Usability]
"It will not work the same on every system, although it tries.",[Usability]
These are vastly different approaches to GUI toolkits and have a lot of consequences.,"[Usability, Legal]"
"Features of widgets that arent the same on every platform might not be supported, or worse, they might work differently on each platform.",[Usability]
"People used to invest lots of effort to get their AWT applications to work consistently across platforms - for instance, they may try to make calls into native code from Java.",[Usability]
Swing itself handles your widgets layout and stacking.,[Usability]
"Today a Swing application can run fast enough to be serviceable or even zippy, and almost indistinguishable from an application using native widgets.",[Usability]
"Some will say it took far too long to get to this point, but most will say that it is well worth it.",[Usability]
:) .. please check my edited question.,[Usability]

It used to be relevant... 10 years ago.,[Usability]
"@Pacerier he was talking about AWT, not SWT.",[Usability]
 some people prefer the native look of AWT over Swings not quite there platform skins.,[Usability]
(There are better 3rd party native looking skins than Swings implementations BTW) Lots of people preferred using AWTs FileDialog over Swings FileChooser because it gave the platform file dialog most people were used to rather than the weird custom Swing one.,[Usability]

Swing occupies less memory space2 .,[Usability]
Swing requires javax.swing package .,[uUsability]
"ForGUI-intensive work, AWT feels very primitive to work with compared to Swing.Because Swing implements GUI functionality itself rather than relying on thehost OS, it can offer a richer environment on all platforms Java runs on.AWT is more limited in supplying the same functionality on all platformsbecause not all platforms implement the same-looking controls in the sameways.Swing components are called lightweight because they do not require anative OS object to implement their functionality.",[Usability]

Rest clients for Java?,[Usability]
With JSR 311 and its implementations we have a powerful standard for exposing Java objects via Rest.,[Usability]
Or specialized clients for e.g.,[Usability]
Jersey or Apache CXR?,[Usability]
The new kid on the block which provides NIO support (although truthfully I dont think this really improves performance for clients like it does servers).,[Usability]
The nice thing is if you implement your RESTful resources using JAX-RS then the Jersey client can reuse the entity providers such as for JAXB/XML/JSON/Atom and so forth - so you can reuse the same objects on the server side as you use on the client side unit test.,[Usability]
For example URL_http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/activemq/camel/trunk/components /camel-rest/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/rest/resources/EndpointsTest.java?r evision=700513&view=markup [here-is-a-unit-test-case] from the URL_http://activemq.apache.org/camel/ [Apache-Camel-project] which looks up XML payloads from a RESTful resource (using the JAXB object Endpoints).,[Usability]

 AWT: Speed: use of native peers speeds component performance.,[Usability]
 Swing: Portability: Pure Java design provides for fewer platform specific limitations.,[Usability]
 Behavior: Pure Java design allows for a greater range of behavior for Swing components since they are not limited by the native peers that AWT uses.,[Usability]
 Features: Swing supports a wider range of features like icons and pop-up tool-tips for components.,[Usability]
 Vendor Support: Swing development is more active.,[Usability]

@ThorbjrnRavnAndersen - consider editing top answer for Java JSON library with your comment.,[Usability]
Heres how it describes itself: Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into its JSON representation.,[Usability]
Gson considers both of these as very important design goals.,[Usability]
"Check out if your version of Java already contains JSON API - see URL_http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/json-1973242.html [Java- API-for-JSON-Processing,-July-2013] and URL_https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=353 [JSR-353] .",[Usability]
"This is the solution I went with in the end, and months later Im very happy with my decision.",[Usability]
The problem with Gson (at least in versions up to 1.4) is that it is not able to handle circular references.,[Usability]
This is very common in some scenarios (JPA/JDO objects being serialized to JSON...).,[Usability]
"Similar API, or something?",[Usability]
Check out the [User Guide]( URL_http://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide ) to get started.,[Usability]
@Johan What would be more reasonable performance and what other libraries deliver?,[Usability]
"@eflat it seems to depend on object size and how you handle the mobile phone memory etc, not only gson/jackson etc.",[Usability]
"However, Jackson performed better for us.",[Usability]
"Ive used URL_http://json-lib.sourceforge.net/ [JSONLib] , URL_http://flexjson.sourceforge.net/ [FlexJSON] and URL_http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/ [Gson] all with great success.",[Usability]
Each has its best use.,[Usability]
Gson fully populates all low level values by calling all set methods for all data found in the JSON.,[Usability]
Some future version of Gson will reportedly support using getters/setters instead of fields.,[Usability]
A comment on issue 232 includes the possible changes necessary to enable getter support.,[Usability]
So I used Gson.,[Usability]
"I cant _truly_ recommend this, because Ive never used it, but URL_http://jackson.codehaus.org/ [Jackson] sounds promising.",[Usability]
"The main reason I mention it is that the author, Tatu Saloranta, has done some really great stuff (including URL_http://woodstox.codehaus.org/ [Woodstox] , the StAX implementation that I use).","[Compatibility, Usability]"
"In addition, I have the following Java class: CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .",[Usability]
Jackson is amazingly customizable.,[Usability]
"I could list many, many more features :-).",[Usability]
"The idea behind JSON is that I should just be able to shuffle data around, I dont have to care about date formats, timezones and all that crap.",[Usability]
since default serializations for different languages are different.,[Usability]
"One thing that might be interesting wrt Jackson is the performance aspect (Jackson is specifically designed as a very high performance JSON package), see [ URL_http://code.google.com/p/thrift-protobuf-compare/wiki/Benchmarking ] and [ URL_http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/09/entry_326.html ].",[Usability]
Jackson is also easy to use.,[Usability]
"I have used Jackson a lot, and it blows the competition away.",[Usability]
and mixins allow great flexibility!.,[Usability]
It also has extensions for object serialization/deserialization.,[Usability]
"I also tried gson: API was very object serialization oriented, and type safe, could not do what I needed simply.",[Usability]
"+1 The way it encodes/decodes to maps, lists and primitive objects appeals to my Python experience too.",[Usability]
JAXB 2.0 also has support for JSON serialization using Jettison.,[uUsability]
"Actually, any XML package that can use Stax API can use Jettison -- JAXB does, so theres no extra work involved (same is mostly true for XStream too, although it may have some additional support).",[Usability]
"If you want to influence the representation in XML/JSON to a larger degree than just naming tags and ignore properties, youll be better of using one of the other libraries mentioned above.","[Compatibility, Usability]"
Gson can also be used to serialize arbitrarily complex objects.,[Usability]
Gson can serialize private fields and automatically ignores transient fields.,[Usability]
Any plans to support circular dependencies in the near future?,[Usability]
"You can file a feature request for the project, if there isnt one.",[Usability]

My biggest complaint with the offerings out there is the size of them - we target a download-constrained applet market.,[Usability]
Ive used URL_http://jettison.codehaus.org/ [Jettison] and it works well.,[Usability]
In this string every JSON object contains an array of other JSON objects.,"[Bug, Usability]"
The intention is to extract a list of IDs where any given object possessing a group property that contains other JSON objects.,[Usability]
The CODETERM1 in JSON represents an array and should map to a Java collection such as URL_http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/List.html [CODETERM2] or just a plain Java array.,[Usability]
This can be parsed with Gson the following way: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Usability]
"Fairly simple, isnt it?",[Usability]
The javabean getters/setters have other purposes in other layers and does not slowdown so I would just keep them there.,[Usability]
I use it in an android app.,[Usability]
It is not the fastest possible solution but it is simple enough to program to justify the lack of performance for the user until now.,[Usability]
+1 for the package com.stackoverflow.q1688099;.,[Usability]

A small price to pay (ugly json) for true serialization.,[Usability]

To answer my own questions: 1.,"[Performance, Usability]"
The increased CPU usage was due to a CODETERM1 loop that was waiting for the threads to finish.,[Usability]
"Presumably the Apache HTTP client will be doing some buffering, with a smaller buffer.",[Usability]
"But really your performance will be limited by the network bandwidth, not CPU bandwidth.",[Usability]

"Boy, Im absolutely in love with Java, but this question comes up so often youd think theyd just figure out that the chaining of streams is somewhat difficult and either make helpers to create various combinations or rethink the whole thing.",[Usability]
You are right.,[Usability]
@Adam: It really depends on what kind of Stream youre working with.,[Usability]
Same with BufferedReaders readLine().,[Usability]

@Ronald: Erm... never mind that.,[Usability]
"Heres a way using only standard Java library (note that the stream is not closed, YMMV).","[Performance, Usability]"
"The reason it works is because URL_http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html [Scanner] iterates over tokens in the stream, and in this case we separate tokens using beginning of the input boundary (A) thus giving us only one token for the entire contents of the stream.",[Usability]
" more edit:** nixed try/catch, Patricks way is more laconic.",[Usability]
"Thanks, for my version of this I added a finally block that closes the input stream, so the user doesnt have to since youve finished reading the input.",[Usability]
I had to add if (is null) return ; right at the beginning of the method; I believe this answer needs to be updated to better handle null inputStreams.,[Usability]
The problem with this approach I find is it does not handle CR/LF translations too well.,[Usability]
So you have to make sure your line endings are consistent.,[Usability]
For Java 7 you can close in a try-with: try(java.util.Scanner s new java.util.Scanner(is)) { return s.useDelimiter(A).hasNext() ?,[Usability]
Unfortunately this solution seems to go and lose the exceptions thrown in my underlying stream implementation.,[Usability]
@Igal I didnt measure it.,[Usability]
A nice way to do this is using URL_http://commons.apache.org/ [Apache-commons] URL_http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons- io/apidocs/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.html [IOUtils] to copy the CODETERM1 into a CODETERM2 ... something like CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Usability]

"Also, there is a method that only take a inputStream argument, if you are find with the default encoding.",[Usability]
"@Guillaume Cot I guess the message here is that you never should be fine with the default encoding, since you cannot be sure of what it is, depending on the platform the java code is run on.",[Usability]
This function is corrupting my input stream.,[Usability]
"In the situation where you want to take something that you know is encoded in the default encoding for the platform, then the default version is correct.",[Usability]
"The trick here is that we work in blocks, and as such dont need other buffering streams.",[Usability]
is there a chance to broke multi-bytes character in this solution?,[Usability]
Its awesome when your managers say Wow James!,[Usability]
"I just think its important to have a good reason to avoid libraries and that the reason is a valid one, which there very well could be :).",[Usability]
isnt it better to close stream/streamreader ?,[Usability]
@coolcfan - I do agree with you on that point.,[Usability]
"Many times, good enough is good enough.",[Usability]
I question how often we put effort into optimizing something that no one notices.,[Usability]
The answer of whether the reward is greater than the cost is a decision not to be taken lightly.,[Usability]
@jmort253 We noticed performance regression after updating some library in our product for several times.,[Usability]
"Unfortunately we are building a product that is available on many JVMs, databases and app servers on many operation systems so we have to think for the users using poor machines... And a string operation optimizing can improve the perf by 30~40%.",[Usability]
Its easier and faster to just read arbitrary buffers.,[Usability]
"I would hazard a guess that any performance loss would be small, or could be handled by every once in a while logging them to a file and destroying the old String objs.",[Usability]
If you are using Google-Collections/Guava you could do the following: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Usability]
"Charsets.UTF_8) for the CODETERM1 isnt necessary, but it is generally a good idea to specify the encoding if you know it (which you should!",[Usability]
@harschware: Given the question was: If you have java.io.InputStream object how should you process that object and produce a String?,[Usability]
 I assumed that a stream is already present in the situation.,[Usability]

Works well on Android in comparison with other answers which work only in enterprise java.,"[Documentation, Usability]"
"Crashed in Android with OutOfMemory error on the .write line, every time, for short strings.",[Usability]
Ive added the encoding.,[Usability]
"Heres the most elegant, pure-Java (no library) solution I came up with after some experimentation: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .",[Usability]
newlines are gone after this.,[Usability]
How about: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Usability]
"As an alternative to the Commons libraries, Googles excellent URL_http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/ [guava-libraries] let you do this fairly concisely; given an _InputStream_ named _inputStream_: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .",[Usability]
"Heres more-or-less sampaths answer, cleaned up a bit and represented as a function: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .",[Usability]
Changed to use StringBuilder.,[Usability]
"I ran some timing tests because time matters, always.",[Usability]
Ranks: Approach Approach - 2.6% slower than Approach - 4.3% slower than Any of these approaches is an appropriate solution for grabbing a response and creating a String from it.,[Usability]
Performance will be the same anyway I think.,[Usability]
If you cant use Commons IO (FileUtils/IOUtils/CopyUtils) heres an example using a BufferedReader to read the file line by line: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Usability]
or if you want raw speed Id propose a variation on what Paul de Vrieze suggested (which avoids using a StringWriter (which uses a StringBuffer internally) : CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .,[uUsability]
"In order to make your code work, I had to use this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream() (using Eclipse with a maven project).",[uUsability]
make sure to close the streams at end if you use Stream Readers CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Usability]
Well you can program it for yourself.. its not complicated.. CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,"[Bug, Usability]"
Thats a good point alex!.,[Usability]
The below code worked for me.,[Usability]
