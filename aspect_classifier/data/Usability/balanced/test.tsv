0	My need is different, I just want to store the data and retrieve it back by decrypting it.
0	Of course you should use Netbeans for building Java Swing GUI.
1	There is vast of Information Extraction algorithms, to name a few: regular expressions, statical methods, machine learning based, dictionaries, etc.
0	Its very cool, very great, but the second you want to do anything other than simple objects, you could easily need to start building your own serializers (which isnt _that_ hard).
0	I have tried padding it out to 256 bits, but then I get an error saying that the key is too long.
0	Pivot.
0	Visual editor has thisfeature that it generates manageable, readable, editable, and easy tounderstand code.
1	You are right - reading is not included - thus I only mentioned generation of his files.
1	Fairly simple, isnt it?
1	Note that the _Part03_ class extends the base _ServerResource_ class provided by Restlet: CODESNIPPET_JAVA3 .
0	For folks interested in using JDOM, but afraid that hasnt been updated in a while (especially not leveraging Java generics), there is a fork called CoffeeDOM which exactly addresses these aspects and modernizes the JDOM API, read more here: URL_http://cdmckay.org/blog/2011/05/20/introducing-coffeedom-a-jdom-fork-for- java-5/ [ URL_http://cdmckay.org/blog/2011/05/20/introducing-coffeedom-a-jdom-fork - for-java-5/] and download it from the project page at: URL_http://coffeedom.googlecode.com/ [ URL_http://coffeedom.googlecode.com/ ] .
1	I have been asking this same type of question now over and over again and I keep getting little to nothing back.
1	Have a look at Webstart for deploying your application.
0	If you use URL_http://commons.apache.org/io [Apache-Commons-IO] its a one- liner: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	ugh?
0	It will only become interesting when youve hundreds of threads running on the same file.
0	A library which helps for basic file manipulation is URL_http://commons.apache.org/io/ [Apache-Commons-IO] .
0	shouldnt it be rn instead of n?
1	Are there any cases where awt is more useful/ advised to use then swing or vice-versa?
1	@jjinguy what IP address should we put for CONNECTION_ADDRESS if the computers are not in a LAN?
1	We have a mix of 1.4.2 and 1.5 Sun JVMs running on Solaris 9 and Linux (Redhat Enterprise 4).
1	Cassandra, Neo4j, MongoDB, etc.
0	Thanks for the comments.
0	So SQL Formatter is not an option for me.
0	Also, did you have Servlet deployment knowledge before reading the tutorial?
1	My interest in log4j 2.0 (over logback) is not having to switch configuration to the new logback style (IMHO its easier to refactor to SLF4J) than change the config of 10 or so projects.
0	The process of entering the rules and logic can be annoying and time consuming, and fixing bugs can be nontrivial.
0	Heres an example of Spring Security 3.x of one of my projects:- CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	You might want to URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/873051 /, which compares SLF4j to Commons Logging.
1	We would like to share this stack with another web application, to avoid having multiple instances of the same objects.
0	The platform default is available from URL_http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/doc s/api/java/nio/charset/Charset.html#defaultCharset%28%29 [the-CODETERM3-class] itself: CODESNIPPET_JAVA3 .
1	So I gave it a try yesterday.
0	javax.security is imho overcomplicated API.
1	when, where, ...
0	Thank you for indicating that there are times when this is necessary.
1	 Hat tip goes also to URL_http://stackoverflow.com/users/68127/jacob-gabrielson [Jacob,] who once pointed me to the said article.
0	@Michael: In my testing, bulk reading/writing ceased to gain any meaningful throughput increase for buffers larger than this.
1	Well you can program it for yourself.. its not complicated.. CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	Second, enabling jasypt is a non-goal.
1	They provide an @MultipartForm annotation which allows you to bind a multipart form to a POJO without writing any code...works slick.
1	The file writer writes to disk using a CODETERM2 to CODETERM3 and CODETERM4 the chunks to disk: CODESNIPPET_JAVA3 .
0	Since there are so many ways to go about it, we could better inform you if you shared your goals and why youre trying to to DIY.
1	@Pelegi, can you mention just one thing that JBoss does better than Glassfish?
0	I just commented on reference to expected good performance.Feature-set wise Jackson handles all the same nesting, layering, generics, so thats not where speed difference comes from.Having getters and setters does not impact performance in any measurable way (for packages I am aware of), so definitely can have them there.
1	 Initialization Vector is no longer fixed encryption key is derived using code from erickson 8 byte salt is generated in setupEncrypt() using SecureRandom() decryption key is generated from the encryption salt and password decryption cipher is generated from decryption key and initialization vector removed hex twiddling in lieu of org.apache.commons URL_http://commons.apache.org/codec/download_codec.cgi [codec] Hex routines Some notes: This uses a 128 bit encryption key - java apparently wont do 256 bit encryption out-of-the-box.
1	But these things are not working in a restful web service.
1	I get a rather useless exception text like: CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .
0	I havent ever really seen it being used in projects.
0	I was seriously thinking i should go spring security despite it said complication, with that im sure i can have people to point me to the right direction.
0	See URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/354837/whats-up-with-logging-in- java [here] for more info.
0	It seems to fit when looking at URL_http://www.slf4j.org/news.html [their-earlier-news-posts] ) SLF4j because they also publish a log4j adapter so you dont have to switch out log4j in older code - just make log4j.properties use SLF4j and its configuration .
0	I would probably use URL_http://platform.netbeans.org/graph/ [Visual-Library] .
1	Features of widgets that arent the same on every platform might not be supported, or worse, they might work differently on each platform.
1	Nikitas point is an excellent one: dont confuse mature with bad.
0	The page describing how to use the URL_http://www.eclipse.org/datatools/projec t_sqldevtools/sqltools_doc/SQL%20Query%20Parser%20User%20documentation.htm [SQL-Query-Parser] has an extremely brief use of URL_http://help.eclipse.org/h elp33/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.datatools.doc.isv/html/reference/api/org/ec lipse/datatools/modelbase/sql/query/util/SQLQuerySourceFormat.html [SQLQuerySourceFormat] which provides these options: preserveSourceFormat the option to preserve the input source formating when SQL source text is generated statementTerminator the character separating multiple SQL statements hostVariablePrefix the character that preceedes a host language variable parameterMarker the character that identifies a host language parameter delimitedIdentifierQuote* the character that encloses delimited identifiers whose writing in case will be preserved omitSchema the current schema (omitted in SQL source, implicit to unqualified table references) qualifyIdentifiers the flag describing how identifiers in the SQL source will be qualified preserveComments the option to preserve comments in the parsed SQL source or/and the generated SQL source generateCommentsForStatementOnly the option to generate comments for the SQL source only in the context of the complete statement, or if set to false, for single SQL Query objects outside the context of a statement as well .
1	The whole API felt really complex and a bit esoteric at times.
0	If you want to set the charset .
1	It has a lot of detail and if you start hand-coding (you will) it offers a lot of flexibility.
1	I agree with Jon on all points.
0	As URL_http://stackoverflow.com/a/9503506/27657 [NimChimpsky-mentioned] restlet will do this out of the box.
1	Looking around, Bouncy Castle had a .NET implementation in addition to a Java.
1	You use String when you are dealing with immutable strings - doesnt make sense.
1	Can some one please explain me what is the difference between swing and awt?
1	Awesome question.

1	You are right in that Spring Data Graph right now does not support compound keys.
0	Because internally CODETERM2 method of each Collection internally calls CODETERM3 over the Collection.
1	With Boon Index Overlay mode, it is even faster.
0	Like I said, its by no means a comprehensive benchmark.
1	* I disagree.
1	JavaFX havent long time any progress, lots of Swings Based Frameworks are stoped, if not then without newest version just my view - best of them is SwingX, but required deepest knowledge about Swing, URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3954616/look-and-feel-in-java [Look- and-Feel] for Swings Based Frameworks .
1	7.
0	Theres plenty of CSV libraries out there, including URL_http://commons.apache.org/sandbox/csv/ [Apache- Commons-CSV] .
1	 swing require javax.swing package.
0	Though, I found quite obvious configuration settings left out in their latest documentations, but I guess this must have been improved since then.
0	Problem with the security is, that usually you need to customize it to your needs, so you may end up implementing : - verifies userName + Password is used like this CODETERM1 CallbackHandler is passed to the underlying LoginModules so they may communicate and interact with users - prompting for a username and password via a graphical user interface, for example.
0	However, if youre free to choose, then you should consider URL_http://logback.qos.ch/ [Logback] instead, the spiritual successor to Log4j.
0	OK, these benefits might not seem so much when youre only dealing with simple webapps.
0	Also note you can read anything that is Readable , like Files, InputStreams, channels...I sometimes use this code to read from the display window of eclipse, when Im not sure if Im reading one file or another...yes, classpath confuses me.
0	See full description here: URL_http://stackoverflow.com/q/5221524/828757 [Idiomatic-way-to-convert-an-InputStream-to-a-String-in-Scala] .
1	as heavily concurrent I assume 32+ cores that dont get starved.
1	Same with BufferedReaders readLine().
1	Simple, clean.
1	Actually, if you want a lightweight solution and dont need transactions or clustering just use Spring support for RMI.
1	SLF4J supports bridging of commons.logging, LOG4J and (a bit cumbersome, but as good as possible) java.util.logging so all logs will end up in whatever SLF4J backend youll use.
1	However, I do share your view on Swing not offering advanced components.
0	Write document: CODESNIPPET_JAVA6 .

1	I found the Glassfish enviroment very counterintuitive.
1	I dont know any better search lib.
1	The ID is the primary key, and enforcing unique triplets after that is going to be on _your_ end more than the NoSQL engines end; this is one area where NoSQL suffers compared to SQL, but its also where you find the greatest speed and storage improvements.

1	There is nothing wrong with swing.
0	The whole point of using InputStream is, that a) you dont know the length of the _complete_ stream (which bails out anything depending on available) and b) the stream can be anything - a file, a socket, something internal (which bails out anything based on File.size()).
