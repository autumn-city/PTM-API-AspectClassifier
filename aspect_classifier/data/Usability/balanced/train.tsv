0	I like XStream.
1	URL_http://www.querydsl.com/ [Querydsl] and URL_http://www.jooq.org [jOOQ] are two popular choices.
1	Most servers have built-in SPNEGO support, so you shouldnt have to code something like an applet to do your authentication.
0	If not, assert it (if you can).
1	Advantages: Single language skills?
0	In this case, the standalone mode is probably a better fit.
1	[enter image description here]( URL_http://i.stack.imgur.com/HRrVE.gif ) here is a picture URL_http://netbeans.org/ [netbeans] built in URL_http://netbeans.org/features/java/swing.html [Gui-Builder] :** !
1	But one thing that should help you specifically is that one of the later chapters of the book contains overviews of several RESTful frameworks, including Restlet.
1	URL_http://www.antlr3.org/grammar/list.html [ANTLR] has an ANSI SQL grammar available.
1	@Per Wiklander I disagree with you.
0	Funnily enough I have just ordered RESTful Web Services on Amazon before I read your post.
0	But who just wants to do that?
1	Its old but should help with the JAAS basics.
0	I provides a great introduction to REST: what it is and how to implement a (practical) RESTful web service.
1	The alternative is to poll for changes at regular intervals, but that may create a delay in the event reaching a client.
0	As with JavaFX, its missing some higher level components like a tree table component ( URL_https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIVOT-306 [PIVOT-306] ).
0	Note that if you are using Java 5 or newer, you should use CODETERM1 instead of CODETERM2 .
0	URL_http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html [ URL_http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html ] .
1	Using the URL_http://commons.apache.org/io/api-1.4/org/apache/commons/io/FileU tils.html#deleteDirectory%28java.io.File%29 [FileUtils.deleteDirectory()] method can help to simplify the process of deleting directory and everything below it recursively.
0	Note.
0	The program asks for the next element when its ready just like a cursor/iterator.
0	If it was rubbish, I would not have been motivated to correct one minor misunderstanding.
1	But this just encourages programming that spots the bug in the wrong place.
1	Probably.
0	For some projects we put together, logging framework was more driven by the open source frameworks we were using.
1	Is Java Swing still in use?
1	Ive used URL_http://json-lib.sourceforge.net/ [JSONLib] , URL_http://flexjson.sourceforge.net/ [FlexJSON] and URL_http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/ [Gson] all with great success.
1	@jmort253 We noticed performance regression after updating some library in our product for several times.
1	4.
1	Id recommend taking a look at Apache Shiro: URL_http://shiro.apache.org/ [ URL_http://shiro.apache.org/ ] It handles the security portion of your application and gives you a great deal of flexibility in how to secure things.
0	but for the 98% case, I think its pretty solid.
0	You to know and specify the character encoding for the stream, or you have character encoding bugs, since you will be using a randomly chosen encoding depending on which machine/operating system/platform or version thereof your code is run on.
1	A nice way to do this is using URL_http://commons.apache.org/ [Apache-commons] URL_http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons- io/apidocs/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.html [IOUtils] to copy the CODETERM1 into a CODETERM2 ... something like CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	It has many problems and I imagine a lack of direction lead it into the mess it is today.
0	see update in my answer.
1	In order to make your code work, I had to use this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream() (using Eclipse with a maven project).
1	Anyway, what is the content of the objects in the SAX2EventRecorder?
1	The number of connections youre talking about tells me you should use java.net.
1	 more edit:** nixed try/catch, Patricks way is more laconic.
1	With Terracotta you can cluster a single Hibernate L2 cache.
0	 Option 2 Disable CODETERM3 (your second jboss-web.xml), bundle your Hibernate JARs into your app and override the hibernate-validator JARs CODETERM4 
0	); I am also in the company behind Querydsl.
0	Can you make some examples, please?
0	URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html In particular, getHeaderField, getHeaderFieldKey, and getContent.
0	If youre looking for a simple stable implementation of a NoSQL DB system, look no further than Apache (they have over 10 years of development experience).
0	Note that the second parameter (i.e.
0	) See also the URL_http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LawOfDemeter [Law-of-Demeter] , which says: Your method can call other methods in its class directly Your method can call methods on its own fields directly (but not on the fields fields) When your method takes parameters, your method can call methods on those parameters directly.
1	My impression is that if the underlying model uses lazy loading, then thats enough.
0	Because such a constructor does not exist, and you cannot extend from String, you have either to create a wrapper class or a method to do this for you.
0	I have tried both shiro and spring security, and I personally feel the shiro is quite easy to understand where as spring security feels complex.
0	In fact i failed to find it so ended up doing my own thing (based on the h2 parser - you can contact me if all else fails).
1	The WindowBuilder items are under General Purpose Tools (or use the filter) Older versions and zips are available at URL_http://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/download.php [ URL_http://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/download.php ] .
1	If you actually dont worry about txt lines, then I would rather use InputStream/OutputStream instead and count the transferred bytes.
1	 This means that your fully qualified name for your class is so we had to alter web.xml to refer to the correct class e.g: original: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	It also has a very fast JSON lax mode and a PLIST parser mode.
0	The requests consist of the incoming rather small request (proper SOAP) and the returning result packet that is essentially one long SOAP string (and the contents of the string are XML).
0	If you want a serialization like DOT NET then you could use URL_http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/persistence3/ [Long-Term- Persistence-of-JavaBeans-Components] The choice depends on use of serialization.
1	Since it is a web application, there are greater chances of multiple threads accessing this component at a time.
1	etc.
0	You can use apache commons.In the IOUtils you can find the toString metod with 3 helpfull implementations.
0	So best keep max one nullable item per line.
1	Best not to leave this kind of thing to chance :).
0	From previous questions I found great example of authenticating with openID on github: URL_https://github.com/gary-rowe/DropwizardOpenID [ URL_https://github.com/gary-rowe/DropwizardOpenID ] However, I dont want to deal with openID at the moment and simply want users to 1.
1	Thats exactly what ( a modern ) compiler does.
0	Specifically you have to add the parameters inside the constructor of the URL.
1	If you have a choice here, you should prefer Qt over SWT.
1	And I am glad I did, because after a day working on it I managed to learn enough about the APIs not only to set up a basic authentication and authorization system in my Spring webapp without trouble, but also to implement the custom SSO behaviour I was looking for.
1	I dont want to store passwords in plain text.
0	Please fix your question to remove the vague and poorly- defined NoSQL and be more specific about what you want opinions on.
1	@Adam: It really depends on what kind of Stream youre working with.
0	UPDATE: A year ago I started actually using Jackson and I can confirm that it is awesome :-).
1	CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .

1	AppScale is open source and lets you run your GAE app on EC2 or your own cluster.
0	Quick to do at first (and a good learning experience), but slow to maintain for production.
1	For example, to reduce the access to disk, you can use a large buffer.
0	I will look it up.
0	I didnt like it much so wrote a new one that we now use in my company.
1	I do have the unlimited jurisdiction patch installed, so thats not the problem :) Ie.
1	I would recommend this, if you really want to support a lot of HTTP servers/clients with minimum code.
1	Aggree that the docs are lacking somewhat, but, IDE support is pretty good, and, googling usually gets you some decent usage examples.
0	My choice is Glassfish: it is faster to start-up, to deploy web applications.the Admin console is very accurate, moreover it is both graphical and command-line.Now it is fully-supported by Oracle, its future is not uncertain any more.It is based upon OSGi: it is really modular.You can install Spring-osgi applications easly.You can freely choice between Eclipse Link , Apache Open JPA and Hibernate without pain.It is greatly integrated in NetBeans (and, of course, Eclipse).
1	Thanks for reply; but it gives error The method toJSONString() is undefined for the type JSONObject at jsonArray.push(jsonObj.
0	I agree that common metrics ought to be exposed via JMX.
1	@Igal I didnt measure it.
1	@Barak Schiller Thanks for posting link to XStream!
0	Serializing is simple.
0	Convert Java AWT code to Android.
1	You probably read something about the Swing Application Framework, which while _built using_ Swing, is not Swing.
1	below is the code i am using.. CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	no tree, no table, no HTML rendering support..
1	If you only wish to invoke a REST service and parse the response you can try out URL_http://code.google.com/p/rest-assured/ [REST-Assured] : CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	Like I said, its not free but given the time it would take to make these things yourself youre probably better off using something that is already made.
0	I had been working 5-6 years to get one running.
0	Could you confirm that this fixes your issue?
1	Jackson is also easy to use.

1	Found a good related topic here: URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/921262 /how-to-download-and-save-a-file-from-internet-using-javaMight give that a try tonight when I get home :).
0	I second that, Jackson is a wonderful piece of work- much more efficient.
1	OAuth2 is going to be the most secure and RESTful approach; as for sending creds in plaintext, are you building a web front-end?
0	If its relatively few (say, < 100), Id go with java.net.
1	The only hard part is when you dont know how many characters you need to read.
1	With JSR 311 and its implementations we have a powerful standard for exposing Java objects via Rest.
1	The NetBeans IDE also comes with built-in support for GUI localization and accessibility.
1	Also, the documentation is messy and not properly updated with new versions.
0	Setting this up is easy -- one need only add this to his command line: -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=PORT There seems to be no available security mechanism, so turning on debugging in production would effectively allow arbitrary code execution (via hotswap).
1	slf4j is the _API_ and logback the implementation of the API.
0	As a consequence i do not know if it has a beautifier, but writing one on top should be straight forward enough.
1	What does the channel means.
1	Maybe it is a matter of definition, but RIA frameworks are basically designed to run in browsers.
1	(not very active though.
1	Maybe we can get some votes to reopen this question?
0	If you can, run the application under Java 6.
0	You also use local references and calling semantic to talk to the EJBs since theyre in the same server.
0	Theyre defined in org.xml.sax.ContentHandler and theres an empty helper class DefaultHandler.
1	ForGUI-intensive work, AWT feels very primitive to work with compared to Swing.Because Swing implements GUI functionality itself rather than relying on thehost OS, it can offer a richer environment on all platforms Java runs on.AWT is more limited in supplying the same functionality on all platformsbecause not all platforms implement the same-looking controls in the sameways.Swing components are called lightweight because they do not require anative OS object to implement their functionality.
1	In the situation where you want to take something that you know is encoded in the default encoding for the platform, then the default version is correct.
0	If you are in control of the method that returns null you could also consider the Null Object pattern if null is a valid value to return.
0	Unless you are looking to secure resources in the Java SE level (classes, System resources), I dont see any real use of JAAS other than the using the common class and interfaces.
1	It introduces CODETERM1 namespace that drastically shorten the configuration from 140 lines to ~30 lines.
1	Naturally, there is no correct answer here for me to accept.
1	Following this law has many more benefits apart from making NullPointerExceptions easier to debug.
0	Swing component is platform independent3 .
1	AppFuse tries to do this, but it aims more at allowing you many different choices when it comes to web frameworks.
1	We can hear you loud and clear.
0	Thats from their site: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	Especially if you want to use it in WebServices you have to set timeouts, otherwise the above code will wait indefinitely or for a very long time at least and its something presumably you dont want.
1	I think this should be public String convertStreamToString .
1	Why not just use a reader?
1	Ive added the encoding.
1	You are right.
0	You application will thus have jcl104-over-slf4j.jar (to bridge jakarta commons logging to slf4j) slf4j.jar (for hibernate and others to use slf4j) slf4j-logj12.jar (for slf4j to use log4j as a backend) log4j.jar (for your application to use.
1	Glad it was able to get you started.
1	2) contains an error, it adds always null at the end of the string as you are always makeing one more step then necessary.
0	 if you need to be specific about the input streams encoding, you can provide the second argument to CODETERM1 constructor that indicates what charset to use (e.g.
0	Wrt speed, if its fast enough, its fast enough.
1	As for your business objects, you can use Terracottas URL_http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/orgsite/Spring+Integration [Spring- integration] to cluster your beans - each web app can share clustered bean instances, and Terracotta keeps the clustered state in synch transparently.
0	Prior to Spring Security 3.x, Spring Security (or Acegi) was very painful to set up.

0	 
0	I agree with the above comments about overriding CODETERM1 on your own classes (and about automating that process as much as possible).
1	You may get better scalability once you are dealing with tens of thousands of connections, but at lower numbers youll probably get better throughput with blocking IO.

0	I have had good success in the past with URL_http://www.bouncycastle.org/ [ URL_http://www.bouncycastle.org/ ] (they have a C# version as well).
0	Because Swing tries to do everything possible in Java other than the very raw graphics routines provided by a native GUI window, it used to incur quite a performance penalty compared to AWT.
1	Do you have an example of a nested select in an IN / EXISTS clause, or of a self-join using aliases for the Sale entity, etc?
0	JavaFX is bundled with Java 7 since u06.

1	The increased CPU usage was due to a CODETERM1 loop that was waiting for the threads to finish.
1	Use byte APIs (e.g.
0	Its certainly not easier to write youve got to do all the path extraction yourself and all the method handling and all the content type negotiation (in _both_ directions) and all the cookie handling and the object deserialization/serialization thunks and well, lots of low-level stuff that would all need testing and debugging or easier to maintain either, since the JAX-RS interface lets you operate at the level of resources (the natural characterization of RESTful webapps) instead of requests; with much experience, maintenance is easiest when the gap between conceptual model and implementation is smallest.

0	Note for those who dont know: JBoss Messaging is a rewrite of JBoss MQ that advertises much improved performance.
0	Any good implementation will use a StringBuilder behind the scenes as you say.
0	 URL_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Widget_Toolkit [SWT] Created by IBM for Eclipse, they seemed to think that Swing was not suited for Eclipse at the time.
0	That means Shiros Spring integration is superb and it all works exceptionally well.
1	do remember that its not guaranteed that the line separator in the file isnt necessary the same as the systems line separator.
1	That way it should be easy to find the source of your NPE.
0	Spend your time learning a more current API and its features.
1	Boy, Im absolutely in love with Java, but this question comes up so often youd think theyd just figure out that the chaining of streams is somewhat difficult and either make helpers to create various combinations or rethink the whole thing.
1	But this can be an involved process.
1	The base difference that which already everyone mentioned is that One is weight** and other is weight**.
0	Other than that theres also: the URL_http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ [IntelliJ-IDEA] visual editor ( URL_http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/gui_builder.html [flash-demo-of-the-features] ) and Eclipses URL_http://www.eclipse.org/vep/WebContent/main.php [Visual-Editor] Personally Ive used Netbeans and IDEAs visual editors.

0	Replace your main class with DebuggerMainWrapper in your start-up scripts 2.
0	Its a subjective question.
1	Thanks for alerting me.
1	 I might regret asking this, but ill try it anyways: C#/.Net is said to have a very good set of easy to use components which can be flexed in every direction possible.
1	is there a chance to broke multi-bytes character in this solution?
1	Thanks!
0	You can describe how your log file should look like.
1	Perhaps youre better off just upgrading to JBoss AS 5?
1	You should also store the salt and the iterations (65536 in this example) so that you can recompute the hash when someone tries to authenticate.
0	Netbeans visual editor is not heavily based on Swing Application Framework at all unless you opt-in to use the framework in the beginning.
0	I think this is the superior option.
1	Console.WriteLine allows the user to specify a position in a string.
1	As noted in the question, this also requires the _Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy_ (else youll encounter URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3862800/invalidkeyexception-illegal- key-size/3864325 [CODETERM1] ).

0	If you are using Google-Collections/Guava you could do the following: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	Its hard to just get it.
1	All youre doing really is allocating 1/3 of the network bandwidth to each downloader.
1	Not that HttpUrlConnection is a bad choice, HttpComponents will abstract a lot of the tedious coding away.
1	The major drawbacks to this method are performance and the fact that our domain classes must be shared through JBoss server/lib folder.
0	 If your string can change (example: lots of logic and operations in the construction of the string) and will only be accessed from a single thread, using a CODETERM11 is good enough.
1	Is there any IDE that simplifies creating Swing applications (ideally something along the lines of Visual Studio) .
0	I came for a solid HTML Parser, and left with one that I wont have to spend the time to generalize.
1	Thanks to that we can easily create statements that are not known at compile time.
1	If you have queries as a text, they will leave broken.
0	You could, setup a third business logic server that has a remote api which your two web apps could call.
0	I have done certain research using MOM with Jboss and GlassFish, but one of the most important impact was the permanent storage if you are going to use any.
1	The answer depends on how you view (the contract of) your getters.
0	Would it not be adding a lot of complexity, in the implementation, for a simple problem?
0	In this case, I was away from my utility code and couldnt remember exactly how to do it.

1	The idea behind JSON is that I should just be able to shuffle data around, I dont have to care about date formats, timezones and all that crap.
0	Its worth studying the white paper on the Form Layout here - URL_http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/forms/ [ URL_http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/forms/ ] Also if you are going to start developing a huge desktop application, you will definitely need a framework.
1	And, the way its held (see update), it may be allocated for each request in progress-that explains why we fail only when certain number of requests are in progress.
1	Thanks, for my version of this I added a finally block that closes the input stream, so the user doesnt have to since youve finished reading the input.
0	CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	Just loop through the file, write every line immediately to other file as you read in, count the lines and if it reaches 100, then switch to next file, etcetera.

1	 - then you just call lc.login(); and authenticate the credentials.
0	I find logging in Java to be confusing, inconsistent, poorly documented, and especially haphazard.
1	There you have it, now NPE points to correct line and thus correct method which threw the actual NPE.
0	Which version of Axis are you using?
1	Scalability will probably drive your choice of package.
1	I was wondering if any of you have any experience with any of these or even better have tried both of them in the same environment.
0	Just an update, but to address James BTW comment, the new version of JAX-RS 2.0 will have a client-side API: URL_http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Java-REST .
0	Copy/paste error messages and output.
0	CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	In other words you need to generate another key to use a MAC, or you could use an authenticated mode of encryption such as GCM.
0	It is regrettable that you are not able to figure it out, but so be it.
0	We do have 1.4 in our codebase - do we use it?
1	You can use URL_http://tomayac.de/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html [RestDescribe] to generate and compile WSDL, you can generate clients in php, ruby, python, java and C# using this.

0	BTW thanks for log4j (original).
1	It has most of the components you are looking for - its got Hibernate, JPA, and Spring with a MySQL backend.
1	JBossMQ may not scale as well as JBM, but to say not scalable at all is just plain wrong.
0	The example uses the UTF-8 encoding that allows expression of the full unicode range (Including Chinese).
1	There are some special cases where the platform default is what you want, but they are rare, and you should be able justify your choice.
1	You can file a feature request for the project, if there isnt one.
0	The question is not one of more sockets versus more threads.
0	Id suggest using slf4j, since it can use log4j as a backend if thats what you need.
0	It really doesnt matter whether youre using CODETERM1 or not.
1	These are vastly different approaches to GUI toolkits and have a lot of consequences.

1	Example: JSONObject#getNames(JSONObject) returns null instead of an empty List or array if no names are available.
1	Also no documentation visible...
1	isnt it better to close stream/streamreader ?
1	(There are better 3rd party native looking skins than Swings implementations BTW) Lots of people preferred using AWTs FileDialog over Swings FileChooser because it gave the platform file dialog most people were used to rather than the weird custom Swing one.

1	Possible typo?
0	I was not always aware of this contract thingy.
1	Sure, they have done things to reduce complexity, like creating custom XML namespaces to reduce the quantity of XML configuration, but for me, these dont address _my_ personal fundamental issue with Spring Security: its names and concepts are often confusing in general to me.
1	 You use URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html [CODETERM3] when you need to create a mutable character sequence, usually to concatenate several character sequences together.

1	URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html [CODETERM2] is a mutable class that can be appended to, characters replaced or removed and ultimately converted to a CODETERM3 CODETERM4 is the original synchronized version of CODETERM5 You should prefer CODETERM6 in all cases where you have only a single thread accessing your object.

0	After reading through ericksons suggestions, and gleaning what I could from a couple other postings and this example URL_http://cs.saddleback.edu/rwatkins/CS4B/Crypto/FileEncryptor.html [here] , Ive attempted to update Dougs code with the recommended changes.
1	So, it is recommendable to use CODETERM4 ( unless of course you have more than one thread accessing to it at the same time, which is rare ) CODETERM5 concatenation ( _using the + operator_ ) may be optimized by the compiler to use CODETERM6 underneath, so, it not longer something to worry about, in the elder days of Java, this was something that everyone says should be avoided at all cost, because every concatenation created a new String object.

0	 You use URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html [CODETERM1] when an immutable structure is appropriate; obtaining a new character sequence from a CODETERM2 may carry an unacceptable performance penalty, either in CPU time or memory (obtaining substrings is CPU efficient because the data is not copied, but this means a potentially much larger amount of data may remain allocated).
1	The downside of that approach is that you inevitably have a delay from the time of the message/event and until the client receives it.
1	If the files are actually also stored in the DB, then this may be memory hogging as wel.
1	@fooMonster Ive edited the answer.
0	Im not saying it is bad.. but there may be other libraries which are worth noticing :).
1	I only had to extend 2 or 3 classes, and the whole thing took only about 25 lines of XML config in my spring context.
1	 Suppose I have an CODETERM3 that contains text data, and I want to convert this to a CODETERM4 (for example, so I can write the contents of the stream to a log file).
0	Once again, these are my findings and your findings may not be exactly the same, but I wrote this to give some indication to others of the efficiency differences of these approaches.
1	concise, but incomplete, it misses the fundamental reason to use StringBuilder/Buffer and that is to reduce or eliminate the re-allocation and array copy of the regular String concatenation behavior.
0	Alternatively, you can use the _jconsole_ tool (which also comes with your JDK) to request a heap dump at any time using the memory management MBeans.
0	i could say, i agree.

1	But every message you send after that should include the unique IV that was used to encrypt that message (and that message.
0	If the key generator cannot generate 256-bit keys for you, then the URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/crypto/Cipher.html [CODETERM1] class probably doesnt support AES 256-bit either.

1	I use Apache HTTPClient to handle all the HTTP side of things.
1	But it depends on the character encoding how that translates to file size (and doesnt work well at all with variable-length encodings such as UTF-8).
0	Your initial question should have stated the exact troubleshooting steps you took - if you ran jconsole, HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError, etc.
1	For others: this isnt a very secure method.
0	According to the [documentation](htt p://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html#available%28%29 ) of the available() method, there is no guarantee that the end of file is reached in the event that the method returns 0.
1	WebServices are working better on GlassFish,I had a number of issues with more advanced configuration on JBoss 5.

1	CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	Isnt this a little perverse?
0	And after investigating different java frameworks to some extent i cant seem to say the same about Java.

0	If, by any change, you are in an application which already uses URL_http://restfb.com/ [ URL_http://restfb.com/ ] then you can do: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	A side effect would be changing the inner state of the object, or something like that.
0	If SWT is missing a feature that you need, the framework is somewhat hostile to extending it.
0	On the other hand, determining your own buffer size(s) you can tune your memory/processor usage balance.
0	Just to clarify, Im talking about Javas built-in collection so I cant override its CODETERM4 .
1	But youre going to be scratching your head the moment you get this error message from your production server logs.
1	It is new, but if speed and simple API is what you are looking for, I dont think there is a faster or more minimalist API.

0	AWT require javax.awt package .
0	If we had hardcoded dependencies on nLog, we would have been screwed.
0	If you are going to build ontology-based search engine**, I recommend you reading URL_http://www.springerlink.com/content/462t8871w5255l13/ [this] paper on ontology-based interpretation of keywords, that shows some tendencies in users habits ( URL_http://videolectures.net/iswc07_tran_obi/ [video-version] ).
0	For code that only open local file, it is a reasonable option to ask them to be encoded in the platform default encoding.
1	That last point is really important, because if you want to build a decent swing application, youll have to extend the base components or use some third-party libraries and it be easy** to integrate those in the visual editor.

1	Is there a method where we can mention REST service server list in ClientResource, in case the server is down try the next server?
0	Your code currently fills the folder list with the top most folder first, followed by its sub folders.
1	The thing is, youre first splitting into lines, and then undoing that.
0	I also think that using read() with arguments like read(Char[], int init, int end) is a better way to read a such a large file(Eg : read(buffer,0,buffer.length)) And I also experienced the problem of missing values of using the BufferedReader instead of BufferedInputStreamReader for a binary data input stream.
1	A better alternative to Jersey/Jackson for building JSON REST APIs?
