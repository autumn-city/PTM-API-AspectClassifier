0	But as you said, either will integrate seamlessly with Swing.
0	 Where as in swing components its the responsibility of to generate the view for the components.
1	Here are some of the links I used to help understand JAAS: URL_http://www.owasp.org/index.php/JAAS_Tomcat_Login_Module [ URL_http://www.owasp.org/index.php/JAAS_Tomcat_Login_Module ] URL_http://www.javaworld.com/jw-09-2002/jw-0913-jaas.html [ URL_http://www.javaworld.com/jw-09-2002/jw-0913-jaas.html ] URL_http://www.jaasbook.com/ [ URL_http://www.jaasbook.com/ ] URL_http://roneiv.wordpress.com/2008/02/18/jaas-authentication-mechanism-is- it-possible-to-force-j_security_check-to-go-to-a-specific-page/ [ URL_http://roneiv.wordpress.com/2008/02/18/jaas-authentication-mechanism-is-it - possible-to-force-j_security_check-to-go-to-a-specific-page/] Also have a look at the Apache tomcat realms configuration how-to: URL_http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/realm-howto.html [ URL_http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/realm-howto.html ] .
1	Best solution for Java HTTP push (messaging).
1	Some of the links I found prior to posting.
1	I hate it when I write a UI and users complain that something doesnt work for them because they selected an odd theme.
1	Yes.
0	NIO has a Charset (not CharSet) class called java.nio.charset.Charset.
1	Sorry, after re-reading my comment, it comes off a little arrogant.
1	Thanks.
1	Has a Maven repository, preferably its already in the main repositories 4.
1	It also makes it easier to make global changes to your Java programs that provide greater accessibility (like picking a hi-contrast color scheme or changing all the fonts in all dialogs, etc.).
0	rather than using native APIs like DirectX on Windows: false, Swing uses Java2D, which may use DirectX when supported.
0	There is no simple way to parse human language, as its construction is complex and it has tons of exceptions.
0	Why ask?
1	Well it depends - not all APIs have the same capabilities as you see, but if you have control over the classes you use to map the XML document JAXB is my personal favorite, really elegant and simple solution (though I havent used it for really large documents, it could get a bit complex).
0	The answer of whether the reward is greater than the cost is a decision not to be taken lightly.
1	I would go with using Jersey or a library in this case, if it does the following (adds enough value): the config for the URL is all self-contained within one file, with the source there are no hidden config files or overly verbose configs (e.g.
1	That can lead to interoperability problems, esp.
1	:) .
0	I encrypted a file using a passphrase then later I tried to decrypt using the same passphrase.
0	At the end of the day, I think choosing either of these two is more about your mental model - which of the two make more sense and is more intuitive for you?
1	You might want to explore it a little bit - see how it is done, maybe get involved in the community, rather than trying to completely solve the problem by yourself from scratch... .
0	Another option is URL_http://www.graphviz.org [GraphViz] which some people like.
0	 There are a few open-source projects that can convert Java objects to JSON.
0	My question is: what are you doing running such an old version of JBoss?
1	@S.Lott - There is nothing wrong with flat files for a simple app.
0	I have a system where Im being fed strings from which I need to (on a best guess basis) remove URLs, anything which might be HTML and anything which might be a date - Ive found Natty is excellent for the latter, but Ive built exceptions for April, May and June, which are valid girls names.
1	Im not sure what problems might occur with the bytes and character sets etc, but it works for me.
0	Cheers mate, I will try that when I can stop hiding from the big scary dead line looming over me :).
1	UTF-8,the JDK will take the default encoding that is taken from System.getProperty(file.encoding,UTF-8); CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	As you can see, I also added suitable code for the CODETERM1 case.
1	Because internally CODETERM2 method of each Collection internally calls CODETERM3 over the Collection.
0	Named entity recognition with Java.
0	Requring, as Doug put it, Frankensteining something.
1	Getters and setters are used in reflection, thats why they are autogenerated.
1	I swear Natty handles pretty much everything.
0	128 bit data encryption using Java.
1	These classes perform XML encoding which is at least very comparable to XML Serialization and in some circumstances might do the trick for you.
1	We currently have a web application loading a Spring application context which instantiates a stack of business objects, DAO objects and Hibernate.
1	] , especially: There are some potentialclassloading issues with CommonsLogging.
0	After that there was the necessity of wrappers to support both LOG4J and java.util.logging.
1	The above is fine.
0	Since the question asks specifically for a String, thats what I show, but if you can work with the CharBuffer returned by decode, the memory requirement is much less.
1	If anyone wants this code, please let me know.
0	URL_http://www.sqlparser.com/sql-parser-java.php [General-SQL-Parser-for-Java] is not open source, but is exactly what you are looking after.
0	Any easy REST tutorials for Java?
1	Im trying to create an CODETERM1 that takes in an CODETERM2 and outputs an CODETERM3 .
0	Applet Portability: most Web browsers support AWT classes so AWT applets can run without the Java plugin.
0	YMMV.
1	 URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8980204/configuring-cxf-with-spring-to-use-moxy-for-xml-marshalling-unmarshalling/8989659#8989659 [Configuring-CXF-with-Spring-to-use-MOXY-for-XML-marshalling/unmarshalling] .
0	I am planning on making a Java Swing application and was wondering if Swing is still used or if it has been replaced with something else.
1	If you have a deep bean structure, everything else will be implemented with dyna beans.
1	What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a Java applet for authentication as part of a web application?
0	@User1 - I like using libraries in my code so I can get my job done faster.
1	It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform.
1	PlayOrm is another solution which is JPA-like but with noSQL specific features like you can do @NoSqlEmbedded on a List of Strings and it is embedded in that row leading to a table where each row is a different length than the other rows...this is a noSql common pattern which is why NoSql ORMs need a slight break from JPA.
0	Why not just use a reader?
0	Which version of Axis are you using?
1	The -- easiest to implement -- algorithm for finding tags will consists of two steps: Extract candidates for tags Find most significant tags - most disti.
1	@wufoo By the way, Dougs code has a number of security flaws.
0	@Alfred, its easier once you get the hang of it.
1	Would appreciate any links.
1	JOOQ is maybe a better choice for hardcore SQL development, but Querydsl has a simpler API and supports also other backends (JPA, JDO, Lucene, Mongodb etc.
1	For the exact same behaviour, but thats obvious, do: StringUtils.leftPad(, 10, *);.
1	Mujer, your domain looks like it would be much easier modelled in the graph database itself.
0	Here is the relevant portion of the CODETERM9 file: CODESNIPPET_JAVA4 .
1	 You use URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuffer.html [CODETERM4] in the same circumstances you would use CODETERM5 , but when changes to the underlying string must be synchronized (because several threads are reading/modifyind the string buffer).
1	Thats where it came from... My Android tools library :).
0	Thanks for the shout out for the Dropwizard OpenID project.
0	I had been using Spring Security (version 3.1) for a few months and was quite happy with it.
1	I could write a simple web service framework in a third of the time it takes me to understand the RESTlet architecture.
0	Another option is to use URL_http://qt-jambi.org/ [Qt-Jambi] .
0	After all, its become the standard way of doing this with JPA, even if its a bit verbose...
0	The latest release in that family is GFv2.1, with a GFv2.1.1 release scheduled in October (see URL_https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/entry/schedule_for_glassfish_v2_1 [ URL_https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/entry/schedule_for_glassfish_v2_1 ] ).
1	Youll just want to keep that in mind as that above comparison is _very_ dated (not to mention probably biased).
1	All youre doing really is allocating 1/3 of the network bandwidth to each downloader.
1	Its been suggested several times on this thread by myself and others, but have you looked at Terracotta?
1	Swing is part of the java foundation classes.
0	You really, should be using IOUtils.copy(inputStream, writer, encoding); unless you really, know what youre doing, which people never do with character encoding related programming.
0	Swing has a lot of rich components but are still lacking in some areas.
1	Take a look at this.
0	The problem is, the application is developed in Java not python.
0	You may need security, persistence, basic user management, etc.
1	Java has come with built-in implementations for SAX and DOM for ages.
0	When we reinvent the wheel, we work twice as hard yet get to the finish line much later.
1	Pivot.
1	Some of you might argue that concatening getters is bad style and should be avoided anyway, but my Question is: Can I find the bug without changing the code?
0	It is not Swing, but rather a planned enhancement to make building Swing applications much easier.
0	According to: URL_http://evilroundabout.blogspot.com.au/2009/11/javascript- printing-rhino.html [ URL_http://evilroundabout.blogspot.com.au/2009/11/javascript - printing-rhino.html] I should use: print(Hello world); but when I do I get: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	It had a decent IDE for making Swing forms and such.
1	I am using JFace and RCP for rich clients.
1	how is this question not constructive?
1	Java date time in arabic.
1	Setters could do a side-effect, but having it in your getter will cause more confusion than it solves.
0	2.
1	+1 for guava, -1 for not specifying the encoding of the input stream.
1	I would use Java Logging if I didnt mind a dependency on Java 1.4 but I would still use Log4J in preference.
0	much better.
0	@Ronald: Erm... never mind that.
1	For code that only open local file, it is a reasonable option to ask them to be encoded in the platform default encoding.
1	Continue down the chain to figure out where your NPE is occurring, without having to change your code.
1	You then say Those connections stay open until they time out or you send the client a message.
1	Since the deadline is looming I thought Id better ask if it is even possible?
0	Id suggest using slf4j, since it can use log4j as a backend if thats what you need.
0	concise, but incomplete, it misses the fundamental reason to use StringBuilder/Buffer and that is to reduce or eliminate the re-allocation and array copy of the regular String concatenation behavior.
1	Try this code: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	(And 3 and 4) This seems to be the nature of the beast; in the end I achieved what I wanted to do by using careful synchronization of the different threads that each download a chunk of data (well, in particular the writes of these chunks back to disk).
0	This is ridiculous.
0	As others have mentioned, my best experience with Java SWING applications is with NetBeans.
0	Regarding memory, there shouldnt be any problem if you use a decently sized buffer (Id use at least 1MB to make sure the HD is doing mostly sequential reading and writing).
0	Furthermore, if your client is also java you can abstract the functionality into an interface and wrap it with a client side proxy fairly easily.
1	GFv3 is designed to be very modular; services start on demand, there is an update center repository, etc.
1	Unlike both mentioned earlier NetBeans editor andWidnowBuilder it uses lazy initialization pattern to separateinitialization of components.
0	Then initialize the cipher with the key _and_ the initialization vector.
1	please update this post.
0	HTTPUnit has a great interface (not much code needed), but the latest version of it submits duplicate requests.
1	It will tell you what those 4 million objects actually contain which might give you insight into why the software isnt releasing that memory.
1	 <strike>** URL_https://github.com/sonatype/async-http-client [Async-http-client] by Sonatype</strike>.
1	@Hello71: It is ok in Java, since the instanceof operator is spelled differently.
1	....... CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .
1	And, the way its held (see update), it may be allocated for each request in progress-that explains why we fail only when certain number of requests are in progress.
0	Many statements share custom constraints which we build by a SQL DSL.
0	@Tovi7 It probably doesnt because most OOTB Collections already provide readable toString()s, whereas arrays dont.
0	Performance and ease of use (yes, Quality of API).
1	If you just want to use something because of the hype, pick anything.
0	That leaves you with SwingX.
0	Dont forget to mention that theres a more preferable constructor in InputStreamReader that takes a CharSet.
1	This allows us to serialize java objects from a document.
1	JavaFX.
0	That is the netbeans one which has been ported.
0	Heres an example of Spring Security 3.x of one of my projects:- CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	Can you update your original link?
0	But who just wants to do that?
0	A + B is a contrived example for sure.
0	The Java tutorials have a good example of this in their URL_http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html [lesson-in-concurrency] .
1	@fuzzy, I agree, specially when you know what the size of the final string would be ( aprox ) .
1	I learned this trick from URL_http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pat/archive/2004/10/stupid_scanner_1.html [Stupid-Scanner-tricks] article.
0	I ran some timing tests because time matters, always.
0	The strange thing is that some servers will reply you back with strange ?
1	CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	As always though, make your own measurements before committing to something you might regret.
0	I.e.
1	You can use URL_http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLC onnection.html [java.net.HttpUrlConnection] .
1	What on earth do you copy...???
0	Open questions that shouldnt be open obviously cause so much more harm than closed questions that shouldnt be closed, so lets be thankful that people err on the side of closing questions.</sarcasm>.
0	Go through it and you can always ask question and problems.
