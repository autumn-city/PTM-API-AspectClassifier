Actually Java supports 4 methods to parse XML out of the box: DOM Parser/Builder: The whole XML structure is loaded into memory and you can use the well known DOM methods to work with it.,[Others]
DOM also allows you to write to the document with Xslt transformations.Example: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]

Those breakpoints fire whenever a specified exception is thrown (you can scope this to a package or a class).,[Others]
EDIT: URL_http://help.eclipse.org/help32/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.,[Others]
You cannot scope them by class/package but that should not be a problem in this case because the breakpoint needs to be activated only one execution reaches the chained getters.,[uOthers]

You have probably heard that enough though and like a previous poster mentioned you can add break points on the actual NullPointerException to see where it occurred.,[Others]

 it seems that JDK1.4x does not allow an interface to be specified for the debug port.,[Others]

The debug socket on your java server can be set up on the local interface 127.0.0.1. .,[Others]

I still maintain that hooking up your debugger to a production application is a bad idea.,[Others]
Users are going to have no idea whats going on when you hit a breakpoint and spend a few moments grepping through memory.I would try to find the spots in your code that are having problems and expose the current state via JMX and keep detailed audit logs of what is happening.,[Others]
I do agree that debugging an app w/ active users would be a really bad idea.,[Others]

Best solution for Java HTTP push (messaging).,"[Community, Others]"
We want to push data from a server to clients but can only use HTTP (port 80).,[uOthers]
Are there other ideas or frameworks which offer lets say JMS over HTTP.,[Others]
"(Yes, ActiveMQ supports it too, but waggly IMHO.",[Others]
And JXTA supports it too but the configuration is complicated.,[Others]
"The simplest solution for many, many reasons is to use a Comet based approach (like you mention).",[Others]
This means the clients (to whom you want to push messages) open long-lived HTTP connections.,[Others]
The client should be programmed to open a new connection.,[Others]
If it doesnt the server has no way of communicating with the client.,[Others]
Having trouble understanding.,[Others]
The client has opened an long-lived HTTP connection.,[Others]
Server sends messages up there - right?,"[Usability, Others]"
"The message we just received contained the data we want, doesnt it?",[Others]
"Once the server uses the connection to send a message, a new connection needs to be opened up for the next message.",[Others]
All of this assumes we have a client that the server needs to be able to push data to.,[Others]
"(Apologies for labouring the point, but this simply doesnt correspond to my experience).",[Others]
I dont see why we need to keep opening more connections.,[Others]
We used COMET in conjunction with JMS using URL_http://www.ibm.com/developerwo rks/websphere/techjournal/0802%5Fhaverlock/0802%5Fhaverlock.html [WAS-Web-2.0 -Feature-Pack] ; in effect the server did the JMS subscribe and COMET-pushed the message to the browser.,[Others]
"I could imagine a pure JavaScript JMS implementation in the browser, using HTTP as a transport but my instict is that this would be very heavyweight.",[Others]
"If your application is very sensitive to such delays, polling is out.",[Others]
It is also more robust against temporary network troubles as the server by default queues messages and wont get upset if the client isnt available on its schedule.,[Others]
There is really no big difference between polling and long-lived connections.,[Others]
The longer the delay is the less connections you have to open.,[Others]
Inside the HTTP/1.1 the (TCP)connection typically stays open.,[Others]
Alternatives to Apache HttpComponents?,[Others]
"So, Ive come to the conclusion that Apache HttpComponents 4 is one of the most overwrought APIs Ive ever come across.",[Others]

Complexity of HttpClient API simply reflects the complexity of its problem domain.,[Others]
Contrary to a popular misconception HTTP is a fairly complex protocol.,[Others]
Being a low level transport library HC 4.0 API was primarily optimised for performance and flexibility rather than simplicity.,[Others]
"It is regrettable that you are not able to figure it out, but so be it.",[Others]
It is a great alternative that might work better for you.,[Others]
I agree with both you (+1) and the OP.,[Others]
"The power and flexibility is necessary, but there should also a set of facade methods somewhere that simplify the process.","[Usability, Others]"
It objectively has a really bad API.,[Others]
HttpClient has to deal with several dozen customization parameters and context specific strategies and objects.,[Others]
"So, flexibility has to come before simplicity.",[Others]
" If HC 4.0 was perfect then that would be a good point, but it is not.",[uOthers]
Could have been.,[Others]
Answering my own question since this got resurrected for some reason.,[Others]
"I ended up writing a few simple wrappers around CODETERM1 , seems its come a long way since the last time I seriously considered it.",[Others]
HttpURLConnection instances are significantly cheaper to create than due to the fact that they share one static JRE wide pool of connections.,[Others]
Per default HttpClient always creates a new pool of connections and therefore is slower to start up and warm up.,[Others]
"This approach is used by HttpClients fluent facade, for isntance: URL_http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-dev /fluent-hc/index.html.",[Others]
Any HTTP performance test that lasts 2 second is simply not representative.,[Others]

If you use URL_http://commons.apache.org/io [Apache-Commons-IO] its a one- liner: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]
I have something like this : CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]
"Your code deletes the folders in the order they were found, which is top-down, which does not work.",[Others]
It might work if you reverse the folder list first.,[Others]
The javadoc for URL_http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/F ile.html#delete%28%29 [File.delete()] public boolean delete() Deletes the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname.,[Others]
"If this pathname a directory, then the directory must be empty in order to be deleted.",[Others]
So a folder has to be empty or deleting it will fail.,[Others]
"Your code currently fills the folder list with the top most folder first, followed by its sub folders.",[Others]
should cause your code to delete the sub folders first.,[Others]
"The delete operation also returns false when it fails, so you can check this value to do some error handling if necessary.",[Others]
close - hes not using arrays but lists.,[Others]
And so you try to delete the folder before it is empty.,[Others]
Try this: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]
Just wanted to tell you I loved this solution.,[Others]
I thought it was easy to follow and simple.,[Others]
Thanks.,[Others]

Splitting a text file using bytes would be a bad idea.,[Others]
do not assign them to variables outside the loop).,[Others]
It will at highest only hit a few % from performance.,[Others]
The same applies on using NIO.,[Others]
"It will only improve scalability, not memory use.",[Others]
It will only become interesting when youve hundreds of threads running on the same file.,[Others]
"Just loop through the file, write every line immediately to other file as you read in, count the lines and if it reaches 100, then switch to next file, etcetera.",[Others]
Just counting the line does not work.,[Others]
Using lineStr.getBytes().length ?,[Others]
For example.,[Others]
Dont forget the specify the proper encoding!,[Others]
E.g.,[Others]
"By the way, its unclear whether you mean to say that the files are stored in the DB or that the file split parameters are stored in the DB.",[Others]
Still worth mentioning :).,[Others]
"Regarding memory, there shouldnt be any problem if you use a decently sized buffer (Id use at least 1MB to make sure the HD is doing mostly sequential reading and writing).",[Others]
Implement this filter to just keep track of the number of bytes going through it (apache commons io may have such a utility in it already).,[Others]
"This may be the case in certain situations, but generally nio was written to be more _scalable_ than io, where scalable is not necessarily the same as faster.",[Others]
I am assuming there is a fudge factor anyway.,[Others]
"@Software Monkey: Hm, wouldnt accessing the HD in 16 KiB chunks send it thrashing pretty badly?",[Others]
Perhaps the OS or hardware cache will alleviate that via prefetching.,[Others]
"@Michael: In my testing, bulk reading/writing ceased to gain any meaningful throughput increase for buffers larger than this.",[Others]
"At the time, circa early 2000s the sweet spot seemed to be about 10 K; it might be a little larger now, but probably not by much.",[Others]
"Its likely to be about X disk allocation unit, where X is quite small.",[Others]
Avoid accessing the disk.,[Others]
Avoid method calls.,[Others]
You can use java.nio which is faster than classical Input/Output stream: URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/io/index.html [ URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/io/index.html ] .,[Others]
Use bufferedInputStream because it supports binary reading.,[Others]
And its all.,[Others]
Does it have to be done in Java?,[Others]
"I also think that using read() with arguments like read(Char[], int init, int end) is a better way to read a such a large file(Eg : read(buffer,0,buffer.length)) And I also experienced the problem of missing values of using the BufferedReader instead of BufferedInputStreamReader for a binary data input stream.",[Others]
"So, using the BufferedInputStreamReader is a much better in this like case.",[Others]
Ive been using this idiom for some time now.,[Others]
Can anyone explain me in a very simple way whats with the NIO?,[Others]
Someone might actually use this example and introduce a bug into his code.,[Others]
The platform default is available from URL_http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/doc s/api/java/nio/charset/Charset.html#defaultCharset%28%29 [the-CODETERM3-class] itself: CODESNIPPET_JAVA3 .,[Others]

You can view the old version via the edited link on this answer.,[uOthers]
I know that is to avoid block the thread?,[Others]
Can you elaborate further?,[Others]
"Do you know the time- and memory-efficiencies of this idiom, or can at least estimate?",[Others]
"Since the question asks specifically for a String, thats what I show, but if you can work with the CharBuffer returned by decode, the memory requirement is much less.",[Others]
"Time- wise, I dont think youll find anything faster in the core Java libs.",[Others]
NIO has a Charset (not CharSet) class called java.nio.charset.Charset.,[Others]
"Note : after exercising a bit that code, I found out that you cant reliably delete the file right after reading it with this method, which may be a non issue in some case, but not mine.May it be in relation with this issue : URL_http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4715154 ?I finally went with the proposition of Jon Skeet which doesnt suffer from this bug.Anyways, I just wanted to give the info, for other people, just in case...",[Others]

"Some example of these things are code and resources available at the JVM level, hence all these ability to set policy files in the JVM level.",[Others]
It is build on top of Java EE security hence Java SE hence JAAS.,[Others]
"Unless you are looking to secure resources in the Java SE level (classes, System resources), I dont see any real use of JAAS other than the using the common class and interfaces.",[Others]
"Java EE 6 Tutorial assumes understanding basic security concepts, so a little overview of JAAS wont hurt.",[Others]

javax.security is imho overcomplicated API.,[Others]
It says how to do authentication and authorization via JBossAuthenticationManager and JBossAuthorizationManager ...,[Others]
You can use it for managing both webapps and standalone applications.,[Others]
"Problem with the security is, that usually you need to customize it to your needs, so you may end up implementing : - verifies userName + Password is used like this CODETERM1 CallbackHandler is passed to the underlying LoginModules so they may communicate and interact with users - prompting for a username and password via a graphical user interface, for example.",[Others]
 - then you just call lc.login(); and authenticate the credentials.,"[Performance, Usability, Others]"
LoginContext is populated with the authenticated Subject.,[Others]

"It explains how JASPIC is the link in Java EE between the Servlet and EJB security models and potentially a JAAS login module, but that in many cases JAAS role is reduced to that of a relatively simple username and roles provider in Java EE.",[Others]
"Overall but a few types from JAAS are directly used in Java EE, basically CODETERM1 , CODETERM2 , and CODETERM3 .",[Others]
The latter two are mainly used by JASPIC.,[Others]
"The different approaches all have their issues, and we are looking for a lightweight method.",[Others]
Then we tried binding the business layer directly to JNDI.,[Others]
"But this led to several new problems: 1) Security manager denies access to RMI classloader, so the client failed once we tried to invoke methods on the JNDI resource.",[Others]
") We havent looked too much into EJB yet, but after the first two tries Im wondering if what were trying to achieve is at all possible.",[Others]

"Best regards, Nils .",[Others]
Could you comment on 1.,[Others]
"I cant speak for Spring, but it is straightforward to move your business logic in to the EJB tier using Session Beans.",[Others]
"Next, you will build each web app in to their own WAR file.",[Others]
"Finally, all of the jars and the wars are bundled in to a Java EE EAR, with the associated application.xml file (again, this will likely be quite minimal, simply enumerating the jars in the EAR).",[Others]
"Each WAR is effectively independent -- their own sessions, there own context paths, etc.",[Others]
"But they share the common EJB back end, so you have only a single 2nd level cache.",[Others]
You also use local references and calling semantic to talk to the EJBs since theyre in the same server.,[Others]
No need for remote calls here.,[Others]
"Also, you can still use Spring for much of your work, as I understand, but Im not a Spring person so I can not speak to the details.",[Others]
"This looks quite interesting, Ill give EJB a shot today.",[Others]

Im almost surprised that we havent been able to find some Spring feature to help us out here.,[Others]
"We have also tried the JNDI route, which ends with the need for stubs for all shared interfaces.",[Others]
"Although JMX is definately not meant for this kind of use, we have proven that it can be done - with no code changes and a minimal amount of XML (a big Thank You to Spring for MBeanExporter and MBeanProxyFactoryBean).",[Others]
"I.e., we have to remove some dependencies from our WARs and move them to server/lib, else we get ClassCastException when the business layer returns objects from our own domain model.",[Others]
"I thought it was time for a little update, because what appears to be the best solution will take some time to implement.",[Others]
"Unlike all the other solutions presented thus far, it is designed explicitly for state sharing which is what you asked for.",[Others]
"The typical solution is to use EJB, but I think spring has remoting options built into its stack.",[Others]

Swing button vs AWT button?,[Others]
You should use Swing generally.,[Others]
The main reason being is Swing was designed to replace/enhance AWT.,[uOthers]
"Swing is, generally, more configurable and flexible to use.",[Others]
"If Swing is deprecated, what is the alternative?",[Others]
What should I now be using instead?,[Others]
_**I never heard such thing and still developing swing apps.,[Others]

It says: The swing application framework (JSR 296) is no longer developed and will not become part of the official java development kit as was originally planned.,[Others]
"Blah blah... It suggests to use the netbeans platform instead (which I suppose answers my question, but I have no idea what the netbeans platform is).",[Others]
"It is not Swing, but rather a planned enhancement to make building Swing applications much easier.",[Others]
Oh!,[Others]
I guess I was confused about the whole thing.,[Others]
Thats a very unfortunate name for Swing.,[Others]
 Development on an open source Reference Implementation called appframework was begun in 2006.,[Others]
"[1] It was originally expected that this implementation would be the means for integrating JSR 296 into the upcoming Java SE 7 (Dolphin) version of the Java programming language, and the project was scheduled to be included in milestone 5 of the JDK7 development.",[Others]
[2] The original Swing Application Framework implementation has been put on hold indefinitely.,[Others]
But SAF has been forked since that time and still exists under the name BSAF.,[Others]
You have to read input-values from widgets and store them in normal variables before a dialog is disposed.,"[Documentation, Others]"
It provides a set of viewers (model driven) similar to a lot of Swing models.,[Others]
"It uses AWT to create an operating system window and then paints pictures of buttons, labels, text, checkboxes, etc., into that window and responds to all of your mouse-clicks, key entries, etc., deciding for itself what to do instead of letting the operating system handle it.",[Others]
Thus Swing is 100% portable and is the same across platforms (although it is skinnable and has a pluggable look and feel that can make it look more or less like how the native windows and widgets would look).,[Others]
":) Here are a couple: AWT is a cross-platform interface, so even though it uses the underlying OS or native GUI toolkit for its functionality, it doesnt provide access to everything that those toolkits can do.",[Others]
Advanced or newer AWT widgets that might exist on one platform might not be supported on another.,[Others]
"Mixing AWT and Swing is highly unsupported and can lead to ridiculous results, such as native buttons that obscure everything else in the dialog box in which they reside because everything else was created with Swing.",[Others]
"Because Swing tries to do everything possible in Java other than the very raw graphics routines provided by a native GUI window, it used to incur quite a performance penalty compared to AWT.",[Others]
Sure.,[Others]
No way.,[Others]
thanks a lot skiphoppy...,[Others]
The heavyweight/leightweight problems will disappear with Java 6 update 12 (see URL_http://java.dzone.com/news/a-farewell-heavyweightlightwei) .,[Others]
"I cant believe they can fix it, and I still cant believe mixing lightweight and heavyweight components would ever be desirable.",[Others]
But its incredible that they can fix it.,[Others]
Just forget about both.,[Others]
"Let me explain, bacially what the term heavy weight means is that when you are using the awt components the native code used for getting the view component generated by the Operating System**, thats why it the look and feel changes OS to OS.",[Others]
 Where as in swing components its the responsibility of to generate the view for the components.,[Others]
"actually Swing uses a Model-Delegate approach, which is derived from the MVC approach, where in the View and Controller are combined for a Delegate structure.",[Others]
URL_http://dn.codegear.com/article/26970 [Swing-vs-AWT] .,[Others]
Basically AWT came first and is a set of heavyweight UI components (meaning they are wrappers for operating system objects) whereas Swing built on top of AWT with a richer set of lightweight components.,[Others]
:).,[Others]
As far as when AWT may be more useful than Swing - you may be targeting an older JVM or platform that doesnt support Swing.,[Others]
This used to really come into play if you were building Applets - you wanted to target the lowest common denominator so people wouldnt have to install a newer Java plugin.,[Others]
Swing components are platform-independent.,[Others]
Swing components are lightweight components because swing sits on the top of awt.,[Others]
 .,[Others]
AWT occupies more memory space2 .,[Others]
AWT require javax.awt package .,[Others]
Difference between Swing and AWTSeveral consequences result from this difference between AWT and Swing.,[Others]
"AWTis a thin layer of code on top of the OS, whereas Swing is much larger.Swing also has very much richer functionality.",[Others]
"So components like JButton,JTextArea, etc., are lightweight because they do not have an OS peer.",[Others]
 awt is not mvc based.,[Others]
 awt does not work faster.,[Others]
 swing componets are light weight.,[Others]
 awt occupies more memory space.,"[Usability, Others]"
 awt require javax.awt package.,[Others]
"Such as hard drive, flash-card, smart-card, eToken, iKey, etc.?",[Others]
In that case you must use the applet.,[Others]
There are times however where an applet may serve a valid purpose.,[Others]
The signature produced will have to re-validated by the server on receipt of the message.,[Others]
Disadvantages: Client JVM management.,[Others]
"IMHO if you dont need something like powerful GUI support or Java2D (most of which can be done with JQuery, ExtJS, etc) there is no real argument for applets.",[Others]
I am trying to authenticate users with a REST service I built using drop wizard.,[Others]
For Signup: Im thinking about sending userss username/password as a CODETERM1 request with the credentials as either form parameters or part of JSON body.,[Others]
"If so, serve your site over https and it wont be a problem.",[Others]
If I go down OAuth2 route I have to register my app with one of the OAuth2 providers e.g.,[Others]
And then I can use that token to authorize the user?,[Others]
"Ah, roger that.",[Others]
much better.,[Others]
Users can signup with Oauth2 as well?,[Others]
Yes they can.,[Others]
"Looking at the docs, we can see that Dropwizard supports a standalone OAuth2 implementation: URL_http://dropwizard.codahale.com/manual/auth/#oauth2 [ URL_http://dropwizard.codahale.com/manual/auth /#oauth2] OAuth2 has several advantages, many of which can be read about here: URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7561631/oauth-2-0-benefits-and-use- cases-why [OAuth-2.0:-Benefits-and-use-cases-why?]",[Others]
 Implementing this does not involve using any third party social authentication services such as Google or Facebook.,[Others]

I know Im asking a very simple and maybe a naive question.,[Others]
But this is a topic every web developer guru will go thru.,[Others]
"For example, you can add an annotation to secure individual methods (for example: you cant run this method unless you are an admin), individual pages (for example: you cant load this page unless you are an admin), and URL patterns (you must be admin to access anything containing /admin/* in the url).",[Others]
"It may take just a bit to get your head around some of the concepts initially, but Shiro does a very good job of hiding as much of the complexity as possible.",[Others]
Also the user list is very responsive and extremely helpful.,[Others]
Some of the frameworks that build on Shiro may offer more of what you are looking for.,[Others]
"For example, URL_http://tynamo.org/tynamo-federatedaccounts+guide [ URL_http://tynamo.org/tynamo-federatedaccounts+guide ] will give you more support for federated logins in a tapestry application.",[Others]

EDIT: This jersey code is handled very neatly and everyone should know how to do it in servlet form if they are looking into libraries to do it for them.,[Others]
CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]
Actually Jersey is the reference implementation of JAX-RS.,[Others]
"So Id call it the pioneer, not Restlet.",[Others]
Your edit makes your question answer itself.,[Others]
But who just wants to do that?,[Others]
"After all, with just GET you shouldnt be changing any state anywhere (well, not state worth the name; server logs dont count).",[Others]
"But is the time to learn, implement, understand for each developer worth it.",[Others]
"If it is just about extracting parameters, then surely it is easier to stay closer to the Java standard.",[Others]
"@avanderw Maybe your experience is only with simple webapps, because I know from mine that it really helps a lot with more complex applications.",[uOthers]

" Would it not be easier (for future developers) and faster (to implement and learn) to map the url pattern CODETERM1 to a servlet and have a line or two that parses the url for the parameters instead of learning, implementing and configuring one of these libraries to do it for you.",[Others]
Its also not faster to implement (because the low-level implementations of JAX-RS have already been tested and debugged for you; less for you to do) and the cost of learning it isnt very high as it is a mostly declarative API with very few surprises.,[Others]
"OK, these benefits might not seem so much when youre only dealing with simple webapps.",[Others]
"After all, you can hack something out in very little time and put the resulting lash-up online.",[Others]
Youll then have to pray that you got it right without significant unexpected avenues for exploits or denial-of-service attacks.,[Others]
And the maintenance programmers will have to understand just what those regular expressions youve sprayed through the code do (Good Luck With That!,[Others]
"But as the webapp gets larger, the benefit of having a tested library to handle all the low-level stuff really does win out.",[Others]
"(Before you ask, some of the libraries you mention will merrily install themselves as servlets; this allows your code to just describe the business logic of the servlet and declare how mapping to the wire is done in abstract terms.",[Others]
) .,[Others]
When would using regular servlets instead of jersey be appropriate?,[Others]
@jontro When you like doing everything by hand?,[Others]
Frameworks are used to make you task more easier.,[Others]
Bu if you are using framework like jersey then u dont have to worry about those parsing patterns and other similar tasks.,[Others]
And one more thing we are taking only a one scenario (matching patterns) but when our requirements will grow the same code written by our own servlets will become more complicated and complex.,[Others]

It has took me hours to untangle their First Steps tutorial (with the help of another Java programmer!,[Others]

"Restlet API** First, there is the Restlet API, a neutral API supporting the concepts of REST and facilitating the handling of calls for both client-side and server- side applications.",[Others]
"This separation between the API and the implementation is similar to the one between the Servlet API and Web containers like Jetty or Tomcat, or between the JDBC API and concrete JDBC drivers.",[Others]
"A connector in REST is a software element that enables the communication between components, typically by implementing one side of a network protocol.",[Others]
Restlet provides several implementations of client connectors based on existing open-source projects.,[Others]
Note that the example above uses a simplified way to issue calls via the _ClientResource_ class.,[Others]
If you need multi-threading or more control it is still possible to manipulate use the _Client_ connector class or the _Request_ objects directly.,[Others]
 ,[Others]
"Listening to Web browsers** Now, we want to see how the Restlet framework can listen to client requests and reply to them.",[Others]
"Actually, any URI will work, try also.",[Others]
"Note that if you test your server from a different machine, you need to replace localhost by either the IP address of your server or its domain name if it has one defined.",[Others]
"So far, we have mostly showed you the highest level of abstraction in the Restlet API, with the ClientResource and ServerResource classes.",[Others]
"But as we move forward, you will discover that those two classes are supported by a rich API, letting you manipulate all the REST artifacts.",[Others]
"In the diagram below, ports represent the connector that enables the communication between components which are represented by the larger boxes.",[Others]
"As explained in the tuto, you only need 2 jars in the classpath, and the source files.",[Others]
It should help you.,[Others]
"Also, did you have Servlet deployment knowledge before reading the tutorial?",[Others]
"If not, that would explain the pain.",[Others]
"In this case, the standalone mode is probably a better fit.",[Others]
We fixed the typo.,[Others]
"Note that in addition to the firstSteps and firstResource pages supposed to get you started quickly, there is a more detailled Tutorial that will walk you through the various concepts of REST and Restlet: URL_http://www.restlet.org/documentation/1.1/tutorial .",[Others]
eSoftHead company has just released a URL_http://blog.esofthead.com/develop- restful-application-with-resteasy/ [short-tutorial] of developing Restful application by using RESTeasy.,[Others]
How do you create Java RESTful clients?,[Others]
This is an old question (2008) so there are many more options now than there were then: CXF** has three different URL_http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-rs-client-api.html [REST-Client-options] (mentioned above).,[Others]
 also has its own called URL_http://blog.springsource.com/2009/03/27/rest-in-spring-3-resttemplate/ [RestTemplate] HTTP Client** build your own.,[Others]
[UniREST]( URL_http://unirest.io /#java) is also pretty good nowadays.,[Others]
As I mentioned in URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/165720/how-to-debug- restful-services#166269 [this-thread] I tend to use URL_http://jersey.java.net/ [Jersey] which implements JAX-RS and comes with a nice REST client.,[Others]
The resource(uri) method is defined in URL_http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/activemq/camel/trunk/components/camel-rest/sr c/test/java/org/apache/camel/rest/resources/TestSupport.java?revision=700513&v iew=markup [this-base-class] which just uses the Jersey client API.,[Others]
"Just an update, but to address James BTW comment, the new version of JAX-RS 2.0 will have a client-side API: URL_http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Java-REST .",[Others]
The link with text here is a unit test case is broken.,[Others]
You can use the standard Java SE APIs: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]
"These APIs are easier to use, but require additional jars on your class path.",[Others]
"You can also check URL_http://www.restlet.org [Restlet] which has full client- side capabilities, more REST oriented that lower-level libraries such as HttpURLConnection or Apache HTTP Client (which we can leverage as connectors).",[Others]
You could try URL_https://github.com/harikrishnan83/rapa/wiki/ [Rapa] .,[Others]
Let us know your feedback about the same.And feel free to log issues or expected features.,[Others]
Rapa has a really nice interface and few dependencies.,[Others]
"It doesnt take long to code, and is quite efficient, in my opinion.",[Others]
In my opinion this is the worst way to do REST.,[Others]
Manually handling serialization in Java is a waste of time when you have so many options like JAXB and Jackson.,[Others]
"i could say, i agree.",[Others]
"I agree too, and I wrote the original comment.",[Others]
"Back then I had a desire for control of the deserialisation, but nowadays I would use Jackson and decently annotated model classes.",[Others]
You can do it in a very simple way with resteasy (by Jboss).,[Others]

Hi.,[Others]
Both are SWT based and provide UI features and helpers that would be tedius to implement in native SWT.,[Others]
+1 for _Why doesnt java (which is the most widely used programming language in the world)_.,[Others]
"It uses native components, so it will only look as beautiful or ugly as the other components generally seen in that OS.",[Others]
"Or to put that another way, it would look much like the equivalent Swing components when they are set to the native PLAF.",[Others]
AWTs major failing is its lack of components & functionality.,[Others]
"no tree, no table, no HTML rendering support..",[Others]
"@netbrain Thanks back at you for asking an interesting, well researched question.",[Others]
"If it was rubbish, I would not have been motivated to correct one minor misunderstanding.",[Others]
I wasnt aware that SWT was based on a combination of AWT and Swing.,[Others]
Is that really the case?,[Others]
I thought it was pure JNI to invoke the OSs windowing system...,[Others]
Frameworks are based upon a given UI toolkit and provide the glue to build your application.,[Others]

Its more a performance patch for Java 1.4 than a UI framework.,[uOthers]
"Without JFace, youre missing many major UI components or very important features of UI components (like filtering on tables).",[Others]
"For example, you cant extend any class in it (the classes arent final, they just throw exceptions when the package of CODETERM1 isnt CODETERM2 and you cant add new classes in that package because its signed).",[Others]
"Lets start with AWT, Swing, SwingX - the Swing way.",[Others]
AWT is outdated.,[Others]
Swing is outdated (maybe less so but not much work has been done on Swing for the past 10 years).,[Others]
The major drawback with Swing is that it hangs on to some old ideas which very kind of bleeding edge 15 years ago but which feel clumsy today.,[Others]
"JGoodies is another layer on top of Swing, like SwingX.","[Security, Others]"
That doesnt mean JGoodies is bad; I just couldnt find anything good to say about it but that it looks nice.,[Others]
There is a URL_http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/webview/jfxpub-webview.htm [webkit-based-component-to-display-HTML] .,[Others]
"When it was introduced, my first thought was five years too late.",[Others]
" If your aim is a nice app for phones or web sites, good.",[Others]
5.,[Others]
Its basically a new UI framework based on Java2D.,[Others]
"No Swing, just tiny bit of AWT ( CODETERM3 ).",[Others]
"Most of the URL_http://pivot.apache.org/tutorials /push-buttons.html [examples-come-with-live-demos] (Note: You must have Java enabled in your web browser; _this is a security risk_) in the web page, so you can see the code and the resulting application side by side.",[Others]
Note that there is currently a bug which prevents some of the examples to work ( URL_https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIVOT-858 [PIVOT-858] ) in your browser.,[Others]
My second impression of Pivot is that its easy to use.,[Others]
"When I ran into a problem, I could usually solve it quickly by looking at an example.",[Others]
"Im missing a reference of all the styles which each component supports, though.",[Others]
Promising.,[Others]
"If you can, give it a try.",[Others]
"@nvrs: Thanks, updated my answer.",[Others]
"For number 1, the sentence you can add new classes in that package because its signed has ambiguity.",[uOthers]
Do you mean cannot?,[Others]
Fixed.,[Others]
"Tried Pivot demo Kitchen sink, after opening some groups it keeps eating whole CPU.",[Others]
"However, JavaFX 2.2 (for Java 7) lacks this, and also lacks standard error and info dialgos: see URL_http://stackoverflow.com/a/12760202/105137 .",[Others]
"However, I also have extensive experience in working with SWT and the URL_http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/JFace [JFace- UI-toolkit] , which is built on top of it.",[Others]
I have found JFace to be very rich and powerful; in some cases it might even be the main reason for choosing SWT.,[Others]
"Of course you can integrate your custom controls as well, but that takes some extra effort.",[Others]
"In your opinion, would an advanced component like a TreeTable with column sorting and filtering be a big issue with SWT+JFace?",[Others]
"@netbrain: I have done that numerous times, its fairly straightforward with JFace.",[Others]

I would like to suggest another framework: Apache Pivot URL_http://pivot.apache.org/ [ URL_http://pivot.apache.org/ ] .,[Others]
I tried it briefly and was impressed by what it can offer as an RIA (Rich Internet Application) framework _ala_ Flash.,[Others]
Miglayout reminds of the days where table tags in html were the standard for laying out elements on a page ;) Thanks for your contribution.,[Others]
Another option is to use URL_http://qt-jambi.org/ [Qt-Jambi] .,[Others]
"I used it 3-4 years ago for a small project, even then it was almost mature.",[Others]
You might want to see the discussion about Swing vs. Qt URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/422956/java-swing-or-java-qt [here] .,[Others]
If you need advanced components (more than NetBeans offers) you can easily integrate SwingX without problems (or JGoodies) as the NetBeans platform is completely based on Swing.,[Others]
There is a large number of excellent Beans you could easily add to your development GUI like i.e.,[Others]
SWT isnt based on swing?,[Others]
(And it never was a really good framework to start with).,[Others]
Swing uses AWT.,[uOthers]
"Some are calling it the successor to Swing, but its still too immature to call that battle.",[Others]
"Its not free, but not that pricey either and it gives you a whole lot more tools under your belt.",[Others]
"Specifically, they do offer a filterable TreeTable.",[Others]
Good to know!,[Others]
"Yes, JIDE has made quite a few components covering grids, trees, tables, graphs and the like.",[Others]

"The problem was that when I the //do stuff runs, it takes a while, and it doesnt let me do anything else.",[Others]
The problem is that you were probably blocking the main Swing event thread (the thread that handles things like button clicks).,[Others]
I discovered them recently and this is really it.,[Others]
IDE for Swing.,[Others]
"@Thorbjrn Ravn Andersen news only all answers about Netbeans and Framework based on JSR296 are outdated because this Swing Framework was refused by Oracle, and later was depreciated in the Netbeans Platform.",[Others]
"Like others have mentioned, Netbeans visual editor is pretty good, but its based pretty heavily on the URL_https://java.net/projects/appframework/ [Swing-Application-Framework] so youd need to get an understanding of how it works to properly use it (although you dont need to dig in to just test things).",[uOthers]
IDEA stores the information in a separate file which means you have to use IDEA to edit the layout visually later.,[Others]
I have not used Eclipses Visual Editor.,[uOthers]
I think it satisfies what most people are looking for in a visual editor and leaves it flexible enough to plug the holes manually through code without affecting the visual editor (so you can switch back and forth between code and design views without breaking either).,[Others]
Matisse did use to have an extra dependency on GroupLayout but now its included in jre so there is no dependency on SAF.,[Others]
"Its all built-in to the latest JREs so you dont need extra jars, but you do need to understand the architecture of the SAF in order to use it effectively.",[Others]
Yeah that is not true.,[Others]
"There are 2 that you can use (Ive used them both, and they are both very powerful, and easy to use): URL_http://netbeans.org/ [Netbeans] which has a built in URL_http://netbeans.org/features/java/swing.html [Gui-Builder] .",[Others]
You can use either one.,[Others]
 is a picture of the URL_http://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/ [Windowbuilder] plugin:**!,[Others]
"It generates proper (actually readable) source code, its very ergonomic and intuitive and, above all, very extensible.",[Others]
Its not free but its a bargain for the power you get (129 EUR / 159 USD).,[Others]
JFormDesinger is the most polished GUI Builder Ive ever seen.,[Others]

"It includes URL_http://www.instantiations.com/windowbuilder/swingdesigner/index.html [Swing-Designer] , which is a Swing UI builder.",[Others]
I think this is the superior option.,[Others]
"Also, the code it generates is easily readable.",[Others]
It handles internationalization schemes and dynamic calls without breaking.,[Others]
"Netbeans has some GUI-building support, and its one of the most popular Java IDEs on the market.",[Others]
Select - Work With: Juno - URL_http://download.eclipse.org/releases/juno [ URL_http://download.eclipse.org/releases/juno ] 3.,[Others]
URL_https://java.net/projects/abeille/ [Abeille] is very good and is based on the JGoodies FormLayout.,[Others]
"Unlike almost every other Java GUI builder, Abeille does not generate code by default.",[Others]
"Most of our hand-written code concerned itself with connecting events to actions, simply asking the layout for the relevant controls.",[Others]
"I have used Matisse, the NetBeans GUI code generator.",[Others]
There might be some simple task like re- ordering a variable initialization and its use or re-naming a variable (this was especially a problem when using Matisses database feature).,[uOthers]
You know how to do this by editing the un-editable source code but may waste time trying to figure out how to do the same thing in the GUI builder.,[Others]
Layout as code is the only approach that allows you to decouple from that particular designer you are using after you have finished.,[Others]
Its so easy if you know every minor parts of this applications.,[Others]
"The most complicated part is using, for example, the layouts (If you can not handle complicated parts), but everything is almost plug & play.",[Others]
"JDeveloper ( URL_http://www.oracle.com/technetwork /developer-tools/jdev/overview/index.html [ URL_http://www.oracle.com/technetwork /developer-tools/jdev/overview/index.html] ) is another solution, and does allow you to edit the code... but I feel netbeans more intuitive.",[Others]
[enter image description here]( URL_http://i.stack.imgur.com/f6bUp.jpg ) .,[uOthers]
"It is still not able to parse any Swing code (I doubt any Swing WISIWYG editor does), but if you start with it, it gives you relatively seamless experience.You need to pay for it though.",[Others]
"At the end of the day, I have worked with different similar UI tools, Flash Builder, Delphi etc., but unless you do some relatively trivial UI design, not including much business logic and communication with other layers, youll have to accept that what you are capable of creating in code once you learn to do it properly is much more powerful than what any editor is capable of providing you with.",[Others]
The Eclipse Visual Editor project is also pretty inactive.,[Others]
WindowBuilderPro is really the viable (free) alternative for Eclipse.,[Others]
All the visual editors are nice if you only have very simple needs like putting a few buttons in a window.,[Others]
"Lastly, changes to the UI wont generate unnecessary noise in the version control system.",[Others]
I have tried a few and the closest I have found that comes close to Visual Studio is Netbeans.,[Others]
"For Swing, they have a fully interactive UI builder.",[Others]
"And, for actual coding, their intellisense cant be beat.",[Others]
JFormDesigner.,[Others]
"JFormDesigner also works with JBuilder and Eclipse, so you are not locking your projects to one particular IDE.",[Others]
"For Eclipse, I am not sure.",[Others]
But its worth trying.,[Others]
"Visual editor has thisfeature that it generates manageable, readable, editable, and easy tounderstand code.",[Others]
"I took it from recent discussion on comp.lang.java.gui (I was the autor of this post so I could do it rightfully), URL_http://groups.google.com/group/com p.lang.java.gui/browse_thread/thread/3722f92594039d24/1f0b605efebb1b39#1f0b605 efebb1b39 [here] is the link to whole discussion.",[Others]
We are doing Swing development since nearly 10 years.,[Others]
"For example, we have a lot of components without public no-arg constructor (e.g.",[Others]
Obfuscation very easily breaks user interfaces created with a GUI designer or requires much work to avoid obfuscating such classes.,[Others]
"Another often happening case is that, for example, a panel should only contain some components depending on some condition.",[Others]
Simply hiding them would make the GUI look bad; they rather should not be added instead.,[Others]
I will prefer the NETBEANS .,[Others]
 and Custom GUI Components**The extensible Component Palette comes with pre-installed Swing and AWT components and includes a visual menu designer.,[Others]
Use the Component Inspector to view a components tree and properties.,[Others]
 Binding technology (JSR 295) Support**Take advantage of Beans Binding technology and the Java Persistence API to create Swing applications more easily.,[Others]
"Using the Bind dialog box, you can quickly generate bindings for JavaBeans components.",[Others]
"I not used anything other than NetBeans for Swing, but have been extremely happy with it.",[Others]
(I always found winforms too limiting).,[uOthers]
It had a decent IDE for making Swing forms and such.,[Others]
URL_http://www.myeclipseide.com / .,[Others]
That is the netbeans one which has been ported.,[Others]
"Use NetBeans, I have also successfully developed one application using NetBeans.",[Others]
Since Swing generates some code on its own so it is really helpful to use Netbeans.,[Others]
"NetBeans has a WYSIWYG editor, and the code is automatically generated for you, which is then protected, however you can add custom code to add listeners and other events that the end user may be interested in using, such as buttons, text forms and areas, and other nice GUI tools.",[Others]

_**Swing is still in use.... but there is AWT!!,[Others]
 Look and Feel: AWT components more closely reflect the look and feel of the OS they run on.,[uOthers]
 Portability: use of native peers creates platform specific limitations.,[Others]
" Look and Feel: The pluggable look and feel lets you design a single set of GUI components that can automatically have the look and feel of any OS platform (Microsoft Windows, Solaris, Macintosh, etc.).",[Others]
" Performance: Swing components are generally slower and buggier than AWT, due to both the fact that they are pure Java and to video issues on various platforms.",[Others]
Since Swing components handle their own painting (rather than using native APIs like DirectX on Windows) you may run into graphical glitches.,[Others]
Applet Portability: most Web browsers support AWT classes so AWT applets can run without the Java plugin.,[Others]
"Most Web browsers do not include the Swing classes, so the Java plugin must be used.",[Others]
I dont recall this being a problem in 2003.,[Others]

"The web site is here URL_http://hornetq.org [ URL_http://hornetq.org ] HornetQ boasts extreme performance, a full feature set and ease of use.",[Others]
Youll find its performance compared to ActiveMQ is _extremely_ good.,[Others]
"JBoss recently redid their entire implementation of Messaging, ala JBoss MQ has been replaced with JBoss Messaging, and now again as HornetQ.",[Others]
"So far, I had a great experience with the community wiki and documentation of Jboss, and it pretty much covers everything.",[Others]
"Though, I found quite obvious configuration settings left out in their latest documentations, but I guess this must have been improved since then.",[Others]
"I have done certain research using MOM with Jboss and GlassFish, but one of the most important impact was the permanent storage if you are going to use any.",[Others]
"I think this itself is very important, especially their compatibility, support, documentations.",[Others]
"If there is active messaging ongoing, it adds up to 10 other threads for such subscriber.",[Others]
On our MQ system we have an average of 3.5 threads per subscriber.Having 300 users served that makes 1000 threads just for MQ.,[Others]
Real world comparisons of Glassfish and JBoss 5?,[Others]
"please, rephrase the question as comparing between EITHER: Glassfish 2 vs JBoss 5, ....or.... Glassfish 3 vs JBoss 6.",[Others]
A number of things from my own experience: 1.,[Others]
2.,[Others]
"JMS works better on GlassFish - this applies to GF vs. JBoss 4.X.As far as I see the JMS implementation was drastically modified inJBoss 5.X, so maybe this claim is no longer true 4.",[Others]
GlassFish is friendlier for developers.,[uOthers]
8.,[Others]
"Even though GlassFish is open source, hardly anyone is ready to develop application server for his/her own needs... From my point of view GF is easier to administer, is a better solution from purely technological point of view, but it is far less popular and has uncertain future.",[Others]
 GFv3 supports JavaEE 6; JBoss 5 supports Java EE 5.,[Others]
GFv3 is significantly smaller than JBoss 5 and will start much faster.,[Others]
"There are other differences, some inherited from GlassFish v2 like the graphical admin console, or the admin CLI.",[Others]
"The latest release in that family is GFv2.1, with a GFv2.1.1 release scheduled in October (see URL_https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/entry/schedule_for_glassfish_v2_1 [ URL_https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/entry/schedule_for_glassfish_v2_1 ] ).",[Others]
"(3) Startup time depends which config you pick, it varies from around 3 seconds for a minimal config, to a minute or ttwo for the bells-and-whistles config.",[Others]
"My choice is Glassfish: it is faster to start-up, to deploy web applications.the Admin console is very accurate, moreover it is both graphical and command-line.Now it is fully-supported by Oracle, its future is not uncertain any more.It is based upon OSGi: it is really modular.You can install Spring-osgi applications easly.You can freely choice between Eclipse Link , Apache Open JPA and Hibernate without pain.It is greatly integrated in NetBeans (and, of course, Eclipse).",[Others]
I started developing a Seam application on JBoss and after a few months tried to get it working on Glassfish.,[Others]
I had to fix some strange errors on GF and I could not find any information on the web so after a few days I gave up and went back to JBoss.,[Others]
Glassfish I never faced any such issues.,[Others]
"Ive also found CODETERM2 , which definitely looks like an improvement, but Im wondering if there is anything that is even better than that?",[Others]
"One thing thatd help is to explain in which ways you want alternative to be better -- more functionality, more convenient, more efficient, better documentation or something else?",[Others]
"Only thing I can think of is type-safety, but when I tried to fix that, it turned out to be impossible.",[Others]
A lot has changed since this question was asked 2 years ago.,[Others]
Here is a more recent benchmark of java serializers: URL_http://code.google.com/p/thrift - protobuf-compare/wiki/Benchmarking Notable: Omitted from the first three charts: json/google-gson and scala.,[Others]
See below for the naked data.,[Others]
"Seeing all the information and activity, it does look very constructive and _perhaps_ it shouldnt have been closed so eagerly!.",[Others]
"I can live with this being closed (voting to reopen, though), but please lets not delete it (it is awfully close to that).","[Usability, Others]"
A lot has changed since this question was asked 5 years ago.,[Others]
I notice that there is also a library called URL_http://code.google.com/p /google-gson/ [google-gson] .,[Others]
I havent tried it yet.,[Others]
It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.,[Others]
Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of.,[Others]
"However, most of them require that you place Java annotations in your classes something that you can not do if you do not have access to the source-code.",[Others]
Most also do not fully support the use of Java Generics.,[Others]
Heres an use example: URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1688099/converting-json-to - java/1688182#1688182.,[Others]
"FWIW, XStream with Badgerfish (jettison) does handle them (since its full object-serialization framework, although resulting json looks ugly, as its xml based, just converts to json via badgerfish).",[Others]
GSon uses the same design protocol JSON.org went with when developing JSONObject and JSONArray.,[Others]
Design protocol meaning... ?,[Others]
I dont see much similarities between the two (which I think is good thing for GSON).,[Others]
"Gson is great, and has high quality documentation too.",[Others]
"When I wanted to use JSONLib; I found out that the jar file that is available in URL_http://json-lib.sourceforge.net has some class dependencies and it needs to be used by some other jar files, that contain that classes.",[Others]
"Incredibly, GSON types [dont implement Serializable nor Cloneable...]( URL_http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/issues/detail?id=485) .",[Others]
Really too bad.,[Others]
"GSON is a good library, we have been using it in our project from past 2years, and it works fine.",[Others]
Gson is very slow.,[Others]
This takes 10-60 minutes on a mobilephone/hand held computer.,[Others]
 JSONLib is awesome as a core JSON library when you just want to process all elements of a JSON.,[Others]
 FlexJSON shines with its deepSerialize method that can properly handle serializing all get methods presented in a bean obtained from Hibernate (lazy loaded).,[Others]
CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .,[Others]
 Gson seems to be the best API to use when you want to convert a json to a Java class.,[Others]
Other API only call set methods on the high level classes in the bean structure.,[Others]
Causes havoc elsewhere.,[Others]
Gson fully populates all low level values by calling all set methods for all data found in the JSON.,[Others]
"When I wanted to use JSONLib; I found out that the jar file that is available in URL_http://json-lib.sourceforge.net has some class dependencies and it needs to be used by some other jar files, that contain that classes.",[Others]
The data I really want is inside CODETERM1 .,[Others]
"Without this capability, I would be stuck writing extra wrapper classes.",[Others]
"Another impressive Jackson feature is the ability to _map classes that you dont own_ (in other words, map a third-party Java class when you cant change the source code).",[Others]
See URL_http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/08/entry_305.html [this- blog-entry] for more details.,[Others]
"Finally, dont miss URL_http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2010/11/entry_434.html [7 -Killer-Features-that-set-Jackson-apart-from-competition] .",[Others]
"I second that, Jackson is a wonderful piece of work- much more efficient.",[Others]
Just curious - why the downvote?,[Others]
I tried Jackson when I was doing interoperability between .NET and Java and dates was a mess for me.,[Others]
I dont understand why its done the way its done in Jackson.,[Others]
Hi Anders!,[Others]
"JSON does not have a Date type (just strings, numbers, booleans), and each lib therefore has to define its own convention.",[Others]
"Ive just ran into some problems with Jackson, Hibernate and Spring, however, I dont know if this issue is related to Jackson or Spring or Hibernate ... see URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3325387/infinite-recursion-with - jackson-json-and-hibernate-jpa-issue.",[Others]
"user268098: I think most Java JSON handling libraries have issues with cyclic dependencies, and most have some ways to either exclude just references, or handle them with annotations (I added an answer in the other question to point out one way to do that with Jackson).",[Others]
"Of alternatives I think only XStream+Jettison handles cyclic dependencies automatically, if enabled.",[Others]
See: URL_http://spring-java - ee.blogspot.com/2010/12/how-to-dumpinspect-object-or-variable.html.,[Others]
"FYI, it appears that Jackson has moved to a new home within codehaus.org.",[Others]
I wanted to represent arbitrary JSON as nearest Java equivalent.,[Others]
"URL_http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/ [json-simple] was excellent: tiny, with a simple API that generates HashMap/ArrayList with a single call.",[Others]
"FWIW, almost all Java JSON libraries support this conversion mode, including GSON, Jackson and Genson.",[Others]
I can recommend URL_http://json-lib.sourceforge.net/ [ URL_http://json - lib.sourceforge.net/] .,[Others]
Thats from their site: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]
I found XSteam useful when converting Objects back and forth between Java & XML or JSON with the Jettison driver.,[Others]
Gson will automatically convert collections to JSON arrays.,[Others]
Gson uses the specified class as the primary specification for deserialization.,[Others]
"So, any extra fields available in the JSON stream are ignored.",[Others]
For more details: see the user guide at the project: URL_http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/ [ URL_http://code.google.com/p/google - gson/] Disclosure: I am one of the co-authors of Gson.,[Others]
And yet another example is here: URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2496494 /library-to-encode-decode-from-json-to-java-util-map/2496528#2496528.,[Others]
"The json.org library does pretty well with serializing basic beans with reflection, but doesnt have these advanced features.",[Others]
"Might be worth checking out, especially if you use an ORM solution.",[Others]
I like FlexJSON as well and even modified it to be compatible with Microsofts JSON serializer really easily.,[Others]
Ive used URL_http://jsontools.berlios.de/ [JSON-Tools-library] and it works well.,[Others]
"works I was looking for a very simple way to do Php json encode in (server) and Java json decode (client), all seems too much to do only to achieve this.",[Others]
I came out to this which is really simple and it works perfect.,[Others]
"I remember lying in bed one night at about 2am wondering how hard could it be, after a bit I got up and started writing - URL_http://www.softwaremonkey.org/Code/JsonParser [this-tiny-parser-is-the- result] .",[Others]
":) Joking, of course.",[Others]
Really easy to map JSON to almost any java object by only annotating the class using JsonElement and then passing the java and class to JsonReader like: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]
"It is easy to use in any project, it is just not placed on the web as a separate project (afaik), however it is in a separate package org.codeviation here: URL_http://hg.netbeans.org/main/file/9609b899e64d/kenai/src/org/codeviation [ URL_http://hg.netbeans.org/main/file/9609b899e64d/kenai/src/org/codeviation ] .",[Others]
A nice new library for Java is URL_http://code.google.com/p/serotonin-json/ [Serotonin-JSON] .,[Others]
It has lots of nice features.,[Others]
"You might want to list some of the nice features, since there are so many alternatives -- project page lists many, although most exist in other libs as well.",[Others]
"), which helps to convert JSON to Java Object- URL_http://prasanta- paul.blogspot.com/2011/04/json-to-java-bean-conversion-for.html [http ://prasanta-paul.blogspot.com/2011/04/json-to-java-bean-conversion-for.html] .",[Others]
The string is available by simply saying CODETERM1 .,[Others]
 _I looked at Googles Gson as a potential JSON plugin.,[Others]
Can anyone offer some form of guidance as to how I can generate Java from this JSON string?_ URL_http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/ [Google-Gson] supports generics and nested beans.,[Others]
The CODETERM3 in JSON represents an object and should map to a Java URL_http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Map.html [CODETERM4] or just some JavaBean class.,[Others]
Just have a suitable JavaBean and call URL_http ://google-gson.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.3/docs/javadocs/com/google/gson/Gson.,[Others]
"html#fromJson%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Class%29 [CODETERM6] .",[Others]
Have you actually measured it?,[Others]
"It is fast enough, sure if you see what it all can do with javabeans, nested javabeans and generics.",[Others]
Maybe in a later version of the app it will be removed for a faster solution.,[Others]
"Wrt speed, if its fast enough, its fast enough.",[Others]
Do I need to create any class?,[Others]
@BalusC : Actually I need to convert mysql data to json (xml) and vice-versa.,[Others]
Any link?,[Others]
For some reason it made me chuckle.,[Others]
"Its very cool, very great, but the second you want to do anything other than simple objects, you could easily need to start building your own serializers (which isnt _that_ hard).",[Others]
"Also, if you have an array of Objects, and you deserialize some json into that array of Objects, the true types are LOST!",[Others]
+1 I agree.,[Others]
"Oddly, the only decent JSON processor mentioned so far has been GSON.",[Others]
If you visit URL_http://json.org/java/ [this-page] you will find several Java classes that can help with this.,[Others]
They are designed to read in a JSON String and provide access to their properties via a get() method.,[Others]
@Malax Thanks for the heads up.,[Others]
Hopefully one of the other suggestions would work better for the OP.,[Others]
"@Malax Since you have access to the code, couldnt you change JSONObject#getNames to return whatever youd like in that case?",[Others]
"But that JSON library could still stink for other reasons (never used them personally, but I know were using them at work).",[Others]
"People are just using it because it has been around for years, and so others have used, and recommend it to new users... basic s/w development inertia.",[Others]
"If, by any change, you are in an application which already uses URL_http://restfb.com/ [ URL_http://restfb.com/ ] then you can do: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .",[Others]
"If you use any kind of special maps with keys or values also of special maps, you will find its not contemplated by the implementation of google.",[Others]

It also has a index overlay mode that is even faster.,[Others]
It can parse JSON to Maps and Lists faster than any other lib can parse to a JSON DOM and that is without Index Overlay mode.,[Others]
It also has the fastest JSON to JavaBean mode too.,[Others]
"In short, its not a very fluid API in the style of, say, JSoup, it appears to be a tool that comes from the era where everything was XML, and then it was retrofitted for JSON.",[Others]
"You can see this, for example, in the requirement that POJO objects need to be annotated with @XmlRootElement even though nothing I am doing involves XML.",[Others]
I even gave up a 300pt bounty and still nothing: [here]( URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6986365/java-rest-client-jax-rs - automatic-type-mapping).,[Others]
[And this one was fun.,[Others]
I dont know why we havent got web services in java tied down yet.,[Others]
I highly recommend URL_http://www.jboss.org/resteasy [JBoss-RESTEasy] for the REST API.,[Others]
It also integrates nicely with Spring if you need that.,[Others]
I have used both Jackson and Gson for the JSON support with RESTEasy and it is quite simple.,[Others]
All you do is annotate a POJO with JAXB annotations and include the proper libraries.,[Others]
I would advise against Spring MVC for REST because it is not JAX-RS compliant.,[Others]
Using a JAX-RS compliant interface gives you a little bit better portability if you decide to switch to a different implementation down the road.,[Others]
"Hmm, Im not sure, it looks like it expects to be deployed in a war file, and I would rather avoid a heavyweight servlet container and all of that infrastructure, the API is just a small part of my project, I dont want to stuff the entire thing in a war just so I can support the API :-/.",[Others]
Run it on Jetty...it will be light-weight!.,[uOthers]
for converting json to pojos : URL_http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/ [gson] and URL_http://jackson.codehaus.org/ [jackson] .,[Others]
If one existed Id prefer a HTTP framework that worked with Gson instead of Jersey as Im more comfortable with it.,"[Documentation, Others]"
With Jersey or any JAX-RS project you can use a CODETERM1 / CODETERM2 for complete control over your JSON binding.,[Others]
As URL_http://stackoverflow.com/a/9503506/27657 [NimChimpsky-mentioned] restlet will do this out of the box.,[Others]
"Furthermore, if your client is also java you can abstract the functionality into an interface and wrap it with a client side proxy fairly easily.",[Others]
Change your code as: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]

most welcome friend!!!,[Others]
Use CODETERM1 method on CODETERM2 .,[Others]
Of course doing it this way depends on how your ids are stored but for me it generally makes my code a lot cleaner and the Jackson Library is pretty good performance wise.,[Others]
"things like: create new file by a defined structure(header,data,trail).",[Others]
(I am willing to map them to objects coz it will be much more comfortable for me to manipulate the fields inside each file via object) I wonder if any of you deal with such things before?,[Others]
"thanks,ray.",[Others]
You may want to look at serialization and de-serialization .,[Others]
serialization wont help me here.,[Others]
I want my own structure in the file since some1 else need to read it by a specific structure.,[Others]
serialization wont map the object to the file in the way I want it.,[Others]
"If you want custom mapping, you need custom coding.",[Others]
"Using these you can control the header, records and footer in any binary format you want.",[Others]
;) .,[Others]
In that case I would serialize as text.,[Others]
";) With the built in Serialization you have no choice, but if you do it yourself, you can make it anything you want.",[Others]
A library which helps for basic file manipulation is URL_http://commons.apache.org/io/ [Apache-Commons-IO] .,[Others]
"Many libraries help you to do this but the file format is fixed: JSON: URL_http://jackson.codehaus.org/ [Jackson] , URL_http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/ [GSON] XML: URL_http://jaxb.java.net/ [JAXB] .",[Others]
@Joachim The libraries work with text output (that is what _rayman_ needs if I understand it correct).,[Others]
He wants text (see comment in answer from Lawrey).,[Others]
Using templates to generate his files will definitly help - particularly if his files contains lot text around the object info.,[Others]
"If you want the file read by 3rd party as well, how about using some popular existing exchange format such as CSV or XML?",[Others]
XML is fully supported in standard library.,[Others]
so I have implemented my own ORM file to objects and vise versa.,[Others]
"Specifically, I need to make a choice for this situation: We have one control center managing hardware at several remote sites (each site with one computer managing multiple hardware units (a transceiver, TNC, and rotator)).",[Others]
"I suppose a third option is to use MINA, but Im not sure if thats throwing too much at a simple problem.",[Others]
"The single client will want to connect to several servers at once, though.",[Others]
"Instead of putting each server on different ports, is it possible to use channel selectors on the client side, or is it better to go multi-threaded io on the client side of things and configure the servers differently?",[Others]
"Really, I just want to be able to send commands and receive telemetry from the hardware, and not have to make up some application layer protocol to do it.",[Others]
"Something else to consider is that if you want to use SSL, NIO makes it extremely painful.",[Others]
"java.nio is much more efficient, but can be hairy to code around.",[Others]
I would ask yourself how many connections you expect to be handling.,[Others]
"If its relatively few (say, < 100), Id go with java.net.",[Others]
With a modern 64-bit OS you can have hundreds of thousands of threads.,[Others]
"Sure, but thats not necessarily the most scalable way to architect an application.",[Others]
@Zombies in what sense?,[Others]
) Take a look at URL_http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/ [Apaches-XML-RPC] package.,[Others]
"No need to worry about protocol issues ... itll all look like method calls to you, on both ends.",[Others]
"but for the 98% case, I think its pretty solid.",[Others]
"Given the small number of connections involved, java.net sounds like the right solution.",[Others]
"large request/responses, or frequent small amounts of data).",[Others]
The cost of XML parsing is typically orders of magnitude higher than more optimised wire formats (e.g.,[Others]
"As an academic test, I decided to implement a basic, multi-threaded HTTP downloader.",[Others]
"I have a working prototype, but as you may have guessed, its not exactly ideal.",[Others]
"These threads use a common, synchronized file writer instance to actually write the files to disk.",[Others]
Some snippets of code to give you an idea: The thread start-up: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]
Each downloader thread downloads a chunk (buffered) and uses the file writer to write to disk: CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .,[Others]
"However, it doesnt work very well.",[Others]
Much appreciated.,[Others]
"Its using half my CPU (50% of each of the 2 cores) to do this, which is exponentially more than comparable downloading tools which barely stress the CPU at all.",[Others]
"Im a bit mystified as to where this CPU usage comes from, as I wasnt expecting this.",[Others]
3.,[Others]
"Despite the fact that Ive chosen quite a big buffer (1MB), I get the feeling that the CODETERM5 almost never actually fills the buffer, which causes more IO writes than I would like.",[Others]
"Im under the impression that in this scenario, it would be best to keep the IO access to a minimum, but I dont know for sure whether this is the best approach.",[Others]
4.,[Others]
"I realise Java may not be the ideal language to do something like this, but Im convinced theres much more performance to be had than I get in my current implementation.",[Others]
Is NIO worth exploring in this case?,[Others]
"_Note:_ I use Apache HTTPClient to do the HTTP interaction, which is where the CODETERM6 comes from (in case anyone is wondering).",[Others]
Update: the high CPU usage was due to a while() loop on the ExecutorService isTerminated() method call.,[Others]
"It will need a buffer to read the HTTP header reasonably, and probably handling chunked encoding.",[Others]
My immediate thought for best performance on Windows would be to use URL_http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365198%28VS.85%29.aspx [IO- completions-ports] .,[Others]
"What I dont know is (a) whether there are similar concepts in other OSes, and (b) whether there are any suitable Java wrappers?",[Others]
"If portability isnt important to you, though, it may be possible to roll your own wrapper with JNI.",[Others]
"It takes TCP a little whiel to find the optimal window size, so if you use parallel connections, this process goes 3x faster!.",[Others]
"This is the reason Im chunking in the first place, splitting the file in 3 chunks allows me to download the same file 3 times faster, presuming a single chunk is too slow to saturate the connection.",[Others]
"The download speed is maxed out though, so this is not an issue.",[uOthers]
Its the CPU usage that Im worried about.,[Others]
What is the easiest way to take the CODETERM5 and convert it to a CODETERM6 ?,[Others]
"I tend to use a set of helper classes that do it once for me, so I dont need keep referring to Google or even StackOverflow for the answer.",[Others]
"For instance, System.console().readLine() (new in Java 6) is pretty easy.",[Others]

We use Querydsl SQL in a few of our in house projects.,[Others]
Ive used both JOOQ and QueryDSL.,[Others]

Can log4j be used as a dumpster instead?,[Others]
Logging by default blocks hard (if you need to log for real).,[Others]
"Log4j is the logging implementation on most JavaEE app-servers out there, so thats a good advert for its concurrency abilities.",[Others]
A bit of investigation highlighted some scarily bad synchronization in the source code.,[Others]
"However, if youre free to choose, then you should consider URL_http://logback.qos.ch/ [Logback] instead, the spiritual successor to Log4j.",[Others]
Saying that after 2 days+night battles vs tomcat data races.,[Others]
Note.,[Others]
Id not call the impl.,[Others]
) For Spring I guess I need some kind of configuration file for the Apache Commons logging component as well where I direct it to use log4j?,[Others]
When Ive set these up I guess to see that everything works I set the logging level to INFO as its fairly certain that all three of the frameworks output some information in that mode?,[Others]
And if it gets us flexibility without added cost theres no reason not to do it that way.,[Others]
Its a new area for me which Im eager to improve myself in.,[Others]
They permit library authors to not force users into having multiple logging library and configuration.,[Others]
SLF4J has a URL_http://www.slf4j.org/legacy.html [commons-logging-bridge] that you can use to replace the commons logging library.,[Others]
I think the schema there explain the situation very well.,[Others]
You application will thus have jcl104-over-slf4j.jar (to bridge jakarta commons logging to slf4j) slf4j.jar (for hibernate and others to use slf4j) slf4j-logj12.jar (for slf4j to use log4j as a backend) log4j.jar (for your application to use.,[Others]
all config will also be done here) .,[Others]
Remember to not confuse slf4j-xxxx.jar with xxxx-over-slf4j.jar.,[Others]
"I thought log4j was a terrific thing, worthy of being made a standard.",[Others]
This is ridiculous.,[Others]
"If you are using Maven and have trouble getting rid of commons-logging, see URL_http://day-to-day-stuff.blogspot.com/2007/07/no-more-commons-logging.html [this] .",[Others]

Log4j 2.0 and SLF4J and the never ending future of java logging frameworks.,[Others]
Now my question is in terms of what I should code against is SLF4J the right choice for the future given log4j 2.0.,[Others]
"For some projects we put together, logging framework was more driven by the open source frameworks we were using.",[Others]
Changing logging backend is not a problem if you are using SLF4J Api.,[Others]
"As far as the user API is concerned, log4j 2.0 is largely incompatible with log4j 1.x.",[Others]
Are you familiar with the log4j.properties translator?,[Others]
I think I vaguely remember seeing that in the logback project but I need one for the XML format.,[Others]

I could whip up some XSLT to translate log4j.xml to logback.xml.,[Others]
Heres the bridge: URL_http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/log4j-slf4j - impl/.,[Others]
Youre likely to be using a number of components which may all use different logging APIs.,[Others]
Its good to be able to consolidate the output via those APIs into a single output route.,[Others]
thats madness...,[Others]
@mP.,[Others]
"- log4j was the first, then disagreement arose, and slf4j+logback was written.",[Others]
 Java logging because you dont want to add in an extra jar.,[Others]
 SLF4j because its newer than Commons Logging and provides parameterized logging: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]
Thanks heaps to Loki for the question.,[Others]
It would certainly emit the same message (at least if entry and object are the same ;)) so please forgive my nitpicking.,[Others]
SLF4J actually is just an API that sits on top of other logging frameworks.,[Others]
"In particular, if you are working in a serious Java web application stack, you are often in _multiple_ logging environments at one time; (e.g hibernate may use log4j, and tomcat java.util.logging).",[Others]
"Ohh because I am looking at the Tomcat logs, and not log4j.",[Others]
"Adding yet another layer of complexity, the application server may have global logging configurations that may not recognize local configurations for a particular web application.",[Others]
It looks more like a rant.,[Others]
It a little bit of a rant.,[Others]
well its not worth a -1 vote ;P But something to ponder about.,"[Security, Others]"
The problems started when Sun actually added java.util.logging to Java 1.4.,[Others]
Before that LOG4J was well established and in wide use.,[Others]
After that there was the necessity of wrappers to support both LOG4J and java.util.logging.,[Others]
This was probably the worst Sun idea ever... and it ultimately led to the wrong assumption that a good Java citizen should use jul.,[Others]
"In defense of Sun it wasnt their code, but came from Taglient.",[Others]
"This is essentially a thread-local Map<String,Object> which you can use to add additional context information to your logging event.",[Others]
"The URL_http://commons.apache.org/logging/ [Commons-Logging-overview] gives the reason for its existence: logging from library code, when you have no control over the underlying logging framework.",[Others]
"As described URL_http://www.kdgregory.com/index.php?page=java.logging [here] , I like to use a LogWrapper object to provide custom stringification (important), and minimize the visual clutter of logging statements (less important).",[Others]
It is possible to enhance the original log4j classes.,[Others]
"Java logging is not my favorit, but this could be because i use log4j from the beginning.",[Others]
Generally I would default to using Log4J.,[Others]
Didnt mind a dependency on 1.4??,[Others]
@TomHe means jdk1.4+ dont be silly.,[Others]
"Actually Ive recently done some work in a system that was still running under jdk 1.3 :-(, and it was less than two years ago I was last maintaining a 1.2** system.",[Others]
"I would suggest creating a thin logging facade that can write to any of the logging frameworks, at which point the choice of backing engine become pretty much a moot point.",[Others]
That is what commons logging does so why reinvent the wheel?,[Others]
Also there are some issues that your facade would have to handle that commons logging already does.,[Others]
It always a good idea to hide underlying implementation.,[Others]
"The underlying logging API tends to be different on application servers compared to Eclipse, for example.",[Others]
About hiding the underlying implementation: All the logging APIs mentioned can do just that: They are interfaces to pluggable implementations.,[Others]
This saved me recently when we ported our framework to the Compact Framework (in .Net).,[Others]
"If we had hardcoded dependencies on nLog, we would have been screwed.",[Others]
clogging has its own way of discovering what framework it will use - its not nice and rather convuluted.,[Others]
Java - Create a new String instance with specified length and filled with specific character.,[Others]
I did check the other questions; this question has its focus on solving this particular question the most efficient way.,[Others]
"Sometimes you want to create a new string with a specified length, and with a default character filling the entire string.",[Others]
Anyone else has a better sollution?,[Others]
"You have a URL_http://commons.apache.org/lang// api-2.4/org/apache/commons/lang/StringUtils.html#leftPad%28java.lang.String,%2 0int,%20char%29 [leftPad] method: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .",[Others]
Thanks.,[Others]
wont the code in Arrays.fill() contain a loop...,[Others]
Yes Arrays.fill does a for loop itself.,[uOthers]
"Apache Commons Lang (probably useful enough to be on the classpath of any non- trivial project) has URL_http://commons.apache.org/lang//api-2.4/org/apache/co mmons/lang/StringUtils.html#repeat%28java.lang.String,%20int%29 [StringUtils.repeat()] : CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .",[Others]
CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]
Do you mind if I ask you a question - Is this causing you a problem?,[Others]
In many (thou not all) cases you can use CharSequence instead of a String.,[Others]
CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]
"One extra note: it seems that all public ways of creating a new CODETERM1 instance involves necessarily the copy of whatever buffer you are working with, be it a CODETERM2 , a CODETERM3 or a CODETERM4 .",[Others]
PS: I would post this as a comment but I dont have enough reputation to do that yet.,[Others]
"You can index into a string in C# like an array, and you get the character at that index.",[Others]
CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]
You beat me to it -- you get the upvote.,[Others]
See sample: string str Tigger;Console.WriteLine( str[0] ); //returns T;Console.WriteLine( str[2] ); //returns g; There you go!,[Others]
So when the application needs to be run only in a single thread then it is better to use CODETERM7 .,[Others]
"Also, using String for logic operations is rather slow, and is not advised at all, since the JVM converts the String to a StringBuffer in the bytecode.",[Others]
" You use URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html [CODETERM1] when an immutable structure is appropriate; obtaining a new character sequence from a CODETERM2 may carry an unacceptable performance penalty, either in CPU time or memory (obtaining substrings is CPU efficient because the data is not copied, but this means a potentially much larger amount of data may remain allocated).",[Others]
See an example URL_http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/data/buffers.html [here] .,[Others]
"Instances of String ARE immutable, so maybe the comment should read Use String when the memory usage due to immutability doesnt matter.",[Others]
The accepted answer covers its bases pretty well.,[Others]
It basically re-sizes the backing Array to 2 times its current size every time it needs to be expanded.,[Others]
In Java CODETERM11 uses a CODETERM12 behind the scenes.,[Others]
If your CODETERM15 is going to be less than 10k then initialize it with the constructor to 10k to be safe.,[Others]
"But if it is initialize to 10k then you write 1 character more than 10k, it will get re-allocated and copied to a 20k array.",[Others]
So initializing high is better than to low.,[Others]
You can see how this degenerates to of re-allocations and copies which is what you really are trying to avoid using CODETERM16 in the first place.,[Others]
This is from the JDK 6 Source code for AbstractStringBuilder CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .,[Others]
One allocation of slightly more memory than you need is going to be better than lots of re-allocations and copies.,[Others]
Call URL_http://java.sun.c om/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html#ensureCapacity%28int%29 [CODETERM22] with the size you want to ensure your resulting CODETERM23 will fit into.,[Others]
"Another alternative, is to create a CODETERM25 implemenation by sub- classing CODETERM26 , and adding counters to track the number of characters on every CODETERM27 and other mutation operations of the list, then override CODETERM28 to create a CODETERM29 of the exact size you need and loop through the list and build the output, you can even make that CODETERM30 an instance variable and cache the results of CODETERM31 and only have to re-generate it when something changes.",[Others]
Does String x A + B; really compile to be a StringBuilder?,[Others]
"Why wouldnt it just compile to String x AB;, it should only use a StringBuilder if the components arent known at compile time.",[Others]
I was wondering about String.format().,[Others]
I havent ever really seen it being used in projects.,[Others]

Real world example: _You want to create a new string out of many others_.,[Others]
"StringBuffer ( the syntax is exactly as with StringBuilder, the effects differ ) About CODETERM1 vs. CODETERM2 The former is synchonized and later is not.",[Others]
"So, if you invoke it several times in a single thread ( which is 90% of the cases ), CODETERM3 will run faster because it wont stop to see if it owns the thread lock.",[Others]
" Just for who is curious, this is what the compiler does for this class: CODESNIPPET_JAVA4 .",[Others]
this is a really bad example.,[Others]
Initializing the StringBuilder with  Dear  means the first .append() will cause a reallocation and copy.,[Others]
Completely negating any efficiency that you are trying to gain over normal concatenation.,[Others]
"What you dont say is, why is not a good practice to do it.",[Others]
"Its clunky and hard to read, and overly verbose.",[Others]
I was thinking more in the chunk of code like a template* and not really in every regular string literal.,[Others]
"Personally, I dont think there is any real world use for CODETERM1 .",[Others]
"Also, CODETERM1 is thread-safe, which CODETERM2 is not.",[Others]
"From the API documentation: As of release JDK 5, this class has been supplemented with an equivalent class designed for use by a single thread, CODETERM3 .",[Others]
"In practice, you will almost never use this from multiple threads at the same time, so the synchronization that CODETERM5 does is almost always unnecessary overhead.",[Others]
"When you are using String, you are making a new String each time you are adding 2 of them.",[Others]
"When you are using StringBuilder, it uses a buffer to make less String addition and will therefore be more performant when you want to add a lot of string one after the other.",[Others]
The only use of that class is if you need to share the buffer with multiple thread (which rarely happends).,[Others]
What is the easiest way to take the CODETERM5 and convert it to a CODETERM6 ?,[Others]
"Boy, Im absolutely in love with Java, but this question comes up so often youd think theyd just figure out that the chaining of streams is somewhat difficult and either make helpers to create various combinations or rethink the whole thing.",[Others]
"Its not that difficult, just annoying.",[Others]
"You to know and specify the character encoding for the stream, or you have character encoding bugs, since you will be using a randomly chosen encoding depending on which machine/operating system/platform or version thereof your code is run on.",[Others]
I must have been partially asleep while writing that.,[Others]
"Heres a way using only standard Java library (note that the stream is not closed, YMMV).",[Others]
I learned this trick from URL_http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pat/archive/2004/10/stupid_scanner_1.html [Stupid-Scanner-tricks] article.,[Others]
"The reason it works is because URL_http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html [Scanner] iterates over tokens in the stream, and in this case we separate tokens using beginning of the input boundary (A) thus giving us only one token for the entire contents of the stream.",[Others]

" more edit:** nixed try/catch, Patricks way is more laconic.",[Others]
"Thanks, for my version of this I added a finally block that closes the input stream, so the user doesnt have to since youve finished reading the input.",[Others]
So you have to make sure your line endings are consistent.,[Others]
excellent trick!,[Others]
"Alternatively, you could use CODETERM3 if you dont want to mix your Streams and Writers .",[Others]
I hope IOUtils takes an optional Charset (or at least the name of the encodding to use).,[Others]
Why copy the inputstream to a writer?,[Others]
"Or read all bytes and use new String(bytes, charset)?",[Others]
"Or in this case, IOUtils.toString(inputStream, encoding).",[Others]
"Methods that use the platform default encoding are almost never correct to use, like every other method that gives different results depending on which machine/operating system/platform or version thereof it is run on.",[Others]
"Also see: ( URL_http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/javadocs/api-2.4/o rg/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.html#toString%28java.io.InputStream,%20java.lang.",[Others]

No it isnt.,[Others]
Only the version that takes a byte[] parameter is.,[Others]
Code that is going to work on a single could be quite sure that default encoding will be fine.,[Others]
I dont know that Id say the default encoding is NEVER fine.,[Others]
"In fact, its not a matter of fine or not; its a matter of which is CORRECT.",[Others]
"However, I believe this is a very rare use case.",[Others]
"The more normal case is that you need to specify what the encoding is, so specifying the encoding is correct.",[Others]
The block size is parameterized for run-time performance optimization.,[Others]
