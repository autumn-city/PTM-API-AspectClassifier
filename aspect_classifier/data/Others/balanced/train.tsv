1	If you use any kind of special maps with keys or values also of special maps, you will find its not contemplated by the implementation of google.
1	The problem is that you were probably blocking the main Swing event thread (the thread that handles things like button clicks).

1	Without this capability, I would be stuck writing extra wrapper classes.
1	The dataset size is fairly small and we do not want to use a RDBMS if possible.
1	There might be some simple task like re- ordering a variable initialization and its use or re-naming a variable (this was especially a problem when using Matisses database feature).

1	How do you create Java RESTful clients?
1	I think the schema there explain the situation very well.
0	If the result of a computation or database lookup is null, when I expected something different then IllegalStateException is a valid choice.
0	_Why doesnt java (which is the most widely used programming language in the world) have the same set of GUI components?_ Is it just that java has based their gui components at a much lower level, and it is possible to write all these advanced components that im looking for, but you have to do much if not all of the work yourself?

1	For Signup: Im thinking about sending userss username/password as a CODETERM1 request with the credentials as either form parameters or part of JSON body.
0	Will they co-exist happily?I thought I would use URL_http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html [log4j] together with both SL4J and the logging component from Apache commons, do you think thats a good idea?

1	A library which helps for basic file manipulation is URL_http://commons.apache.org/io/ [Apache-Commons-IO] .
1	If the key generator cannot generate 256-bit keys for you, then the URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/crypto/Cipher.html [CODETERM1] class probably doesnt support AES 256-bit either.
1	You say you have the unlimited jurisdiction patch installed, so the AES-256 cipher should be supported (but then 256-bit keys should be too, so this might be a configuration problem).

0	Yes, but this automatically generates a key ... but since I want to encrypt data between two places, I need to know the key beforehand, so I need to specify one instead of generate one.
1	just as a side note, the original readFully method I have in my code does not return String, it returns byte[] for a more general purpose functionality.
1	This is the reason Im chunking in the first place, splitting the file in 3 chunks allows me to download the same file 3 times faster, presuming a single chunk is too slow to saturate the connection.
0	When we reinvent the wheel, we work twice as hard yet get to the finish line much later.
0	The learning curve is a bit steep for the NetBeans platform (although I guess thats true for Eclipse as well) but there are some good books around which I would highly recommend.

1	I am planning on making a Java Swing application and was wondering if Swing is still used or if it has been replaced with something else.
1	For example, you cant extend any class in it (the classes arent final, they just throw exceptions when the package of CODETERM1 isnt CODETERM2 and you cant add new classes in that package because its signed).
0	There is a lot of tuning in Swing that cannot be attributed to Moores law.

0	You probably read something about the Swing Application Framework, which while _built using_ Swing, is not Swing.
1	Without salts, a dictionary attack could be used, enabling a pre-computed list of the most likely symmetric encryption keys.

0	Cry me a river, Ill do it this way all the time just to spite you all.
0	But if you are building CODETERM13 objects that are large, say less than 4k, then declaring CODETERM14 is much more efficient than concatenation or using the URL_http:/ /java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html#StringBuilder%28% 29 [default] which is only 16 characters.

0	@Guillaume Cot I guess the message here is that you never should be fine with the default encoding, since you cannot be sure of what it is, depending on the platform the java code is run on.
0	It looks like it uses reflection on bean-style properties and uses similar rules as Hibernate/JPA lazy-loading for serialization, so if you give it an object to serialize it will leave out collections (unless you tell it to include them) so you dont end up serializing the entire object graph.

1	InputStream in _/* your InputStream is new InputStreamReader(in);StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder();BufferedReader br new BufferedReader(is);String read br.readLine();while(read != null) { //System.out.println(read); sb.append(read); read sb.toString(); .
0	Yes... what is wrong with the existing ones?
1	Promising.
1	You create XML script files to instruct the scraper how to extract the information you need and from where.
1	Listening to Web browsers** Now, we want to see how the Restlet framework can listen to client requests and reply to them.
1	This is a very simple, probably a most asked question and frequently developed as part of any web application.

0	Read/convert an InputStream to a String.
1	That said, there are probably a hundred better ways to do it (just, this method has less code).
0	So as a conclusion, on the ease of use and learning curve aspects, Shiro is really quite likeable, and I think I will probably go with it in the future, unless I encounter some features lacking or some other problem (which I havent so far).

0	As it turns out, CODETERM2 is a much better alternative to wait for an CODETERM3 to finish :) 2.
0	I found this piece of code more understadable and working: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	 Details:** Also note that CODETERM7 arent magic, they just use an Array as a backing object and that Array has to be re-allocated when ever it gets full.
1	CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	There are numerous algorithms to find similar strings, Levenshtein distance, Daitch-Mokotoff Soundex, n-grams etc.
0	It only works for a limited set of platforms and of course requires some third party shared libraries.
1	I ended up writing a few simple wrappers around CODETERM1 , seems its come a long way since the last time I seriously considered it.
0	java.net will require one thread per socket.
1	If your code is running in a web browser, you will likely use other things.
0	That can lead to interoperability problems, esp.
1	however CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	Only disadvantage of VE is that it uses eclipse callisto (there is noofficial build for ganymede, or europa), so effectively you have touse two eclipses one for VE and one for rest of developement.
1	Implement this filter to just keep track of the number of bytes going through it (apache commons io may have such a utility in it already).
1	I would ask yourself how many connections you expect to be handling.

0	Having recently worked on a project which required some more IO interaction than Im used to, I felt like I wanted to look past the regular libraries (Commons IO, in particular) and tackle some more in depth IO issues.
1	MetroidFan2002, note that Im not proposing any side effects, which we all agree would be bad.
0	Using JAX-RS, mainly via Apache CXF, for roughly two years now, Id always prefer it over plain Servlets.
1	The debug socket on your java server can be set up on the local interface 127.0.0.1. .
1	You have probably heard that enough though and like a previous poster mentioned you can add break points on the actual NullPointerException to see where it occurred.
0	The program asks for the next element when its ready just like a cursor/iterator.
0	For simple use cases you can use URL_http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents- client-ga/fluent-hc/ [HttpClient-Fluent-API] .
1	When I wanted to use JSONLib; I found out that the jar file that is available in URL_http://json-lib.sourceforge.net has some class dependencies and it needs to be used by some other jar files, that contain that classes.
0	A quick but not clean solution.
0	You can use the CODETERM2 annotation to flag other types (such as ServletContext or the HttpServletRequest specifically).
0	 Bar** The CODETERM1 in Swing is easy enough to use.
1	Run the program in debug mode, allow the debugger to switch over to its perspective when the line is hit.
0	You can use URL_http://tomayac.de/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html [RestDescribe] to generate and compile WSDL, you can generate clients in php, ruby, python, java and C# using this.
0	Better to use SWT if you want to go down the native path.
0	Or you can use the REST client APIs provided by JAX-RS implementations such as Jersey.
0	Youll use it just as a key-value storage.
0	If you want to influence the representation in XML/JSON to a larger degree than just naming tags and ignore properties, youll be better of using one of the other libraries mentioned above.

0	Also, there is some value to creating your own wrappers around whatever framework you use.
1	@Arkadiy: Dont assume theres a bug in JBoss; assume the bug is in your code.
0	Wed actually be taking the badly behaving instance out of our load-balanced cluster before debugging.
1	Problem with the security is, that usually you need to customize it to your needs, so you may end up implementing : - verifies userName + Password is used like this CODETERM1 CallbackHandler is passed to the underlying LoginModules so they may communicate and interact with users - prompting for a username and password via a graphical user interface, for example.
0	Please add an explanation rather than just dumping code as your answer.
0	 some people prefer the native look of AWT over Swings not quite there platform skins.
1	This is an old question (2008) so there are many more options now than there were then: CXF** has three different URL_http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-rs-client-api.html [REST-Client-options] (mentioned above).

0	Qt has been developed by people who understand UI and the desktop while SWT has been developed out of necessity to make Eclipse faster.
0	Thanks Michael, after trying out many things in JCE, I finally settled for bouncycastle.
0	JPA modelling is ok, but I dont know how to do the same in NOSQL .
1	This saved me recently when we ported our framework to the Compact Framework (in .Net).
0	Its highly recommended to ignore this method so much so that you could treat this to be a restricted API.
0	A brief introduction from Apache Tika web site: The Apache Tika toolkit detects and extracts metadata and structured text content from various documents using existing parser libraries.
1	This is a drop-in replacement that mimics JCLs classes, but calls SLF4J internally.
0	@coolcfan - I do agree with you on that point.
0	Querydsl and jOOQ seem to be the most popular and mature choices however theres one thing to be aware of: Both rely on the concept of code generation, where meta classes are generated for database tables and fields.
1	Each downloader thread downloads a chunk (buffered) and uses the file writer to write to disk: CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .
1	You would probably also want to send control headers prior to the actual file being sent, containing the size of the file, filename, etc.
1	So it is CODETERM1 and no extra libraries to download and manage.A simple example can be found URL_ht tp://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/JDK-6/MarshalJavaobjecttoxmlandoutputtoconsole.h tm [here] XStream seems to be dead.

0	+1 for Web Harvest -- if you are trying to do page scraping it is the way to go.
0	Can anyone offer some form of guidance as to how I can generate Java from this JSON string?
0	At what point is it better to switch from java.net to java.nio?
0	I would hazard a guess that any performance loss would be small, or could be handled by every once in a while logging them to a file and destroying the old String objs.
0	Methods like public static InputStream httpGetAsStream(String baseUrl, Map<string, object=> parameters).
1	Also, if you have an array of Objects, and you deserialize some json into that array of Objects, the true types are LOST!
0	As far as I can tell the idea behind commons logging is that it should be used in libraries.
0	While jOOQ supports a String based approached there are some quirks.
1	PS I know the venerable HttpClient 3.1 is still there, but Id like to use something thats supported.

1	For Eclipse, I am not sure.
1	You can use it for managing both webapps and standalone applications.
1	What Ive done in the past is hash the key via something like SHA256, then extract the bytes from the hash into the key byte[].
0	These classes perform XML encoding which is at least very comparable to XML Serialization and in some circumstances might do the trick for you.
1	The only use of that class is if you need to share the buffer with multiple thread (which rarely happends).
0	I dont think its particularly practice, but I certainly wouldnt want any recommendation to do that in general.
0	I only had to extend 2 or 3 classes, and the whole thing took only about 25 lines of XML config in my spring context.
1	We tried to use the standard Java and C# encryption packages but we found too many issues with the encrypt/decrypt.
1	I dont recall this being a problem in 2003.

0	Gson is great.
1	While not flawless, have you considered the standard URLConnection/HTTPUrlConnection ?
1	Are you asking why the example you linked to doesnt use salt and password?
0	As an alternative to the Commons libraries, Googles excellent URL_http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/ [guava-libraries] let you do this fairly concisely; given an _InputStream_ named _inputStream_: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	Implementing the new String(...) with encoding is the responsibility of the on that uses the API!.

1	And then I can use that token to authorize the user?
0	Please let me know if you have any idea about this.
1	Design protocol meaning... ?
1	GSon uses the same design protocol JSON.org went with when developing JSONObject and JSONArray.

1	Apache has recently extracted many sub-projects out of the existing projects and made them public.
0	Give how complex it can be do to security right, Shiro is very simple to use.
1	When you are using StringBuilder, it uses a buffer to make less String addition and will therefore be more performant when you want to add a lot of string one after the other.
0	By looking at the Pivot docs, a lot of effort must have went into the code.
0	Thanks.
1	If this would be the only use of the library, it would be overkill to use the library.

1	That is what commons logging does so why reinvent the wheel?
0	Also, if native OS specific APIs like MSCAPI have to be accessed, then deployment of native code (DLLs) is a pre-requisite, and the software (not the applet) responsible for doing so, must be coded securely.
0	I hope IOUtils takes an optional Charset (or at least the name of the encodding to use).
0	I tried reading an exe file using this method with default charset, append some data in it and again make it an exe, But it corrupted the exe, Any thoughts ?

1	Despite the fact that Ive chosen quite a big buffer (1MB), I get the feeling that the CODETERM5 almost never actually fills the buffer, which causes more IO writes than I would like.
1	Like others have mentioned, Netbeans visual editor is pretty good, but its based pretty heavily on the URL_https://java.net/projects/appframework/ [Swing-Application-Framework] so youd need to get an understanding of how it works to properly use it (although you dont need to dig in to just test things).

0	If I were in your shoes, Id go with this option just because I know that it would show great performance, there are mature tools for working with MySql, many people have experience with it and at any time you can easily use all its relational potential if you eventually decide to go back to RDBMS solutions.
1	Only thing I can think of is type-safety, but when I tried to fix that, it turned out to be impossible.
0	+1.
1	I have used both Jackson and Gson for the JSON support with RESTEasy and it is quite simple.
0	Shiro vs. SpringSecurity.
0	One of the shortcomings of the json.org library is that it accepts unquoted strings, breaking the JSON specification.
0	One example being that there isnt a full featured TreeTable component which can do sorting and filtering/searching.
0	Libraries like netty also obviate the async vs threads question almost entirely, gives you good performance, and still lets you tweak the threading model as needed.
1	 You use URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html [CODETERM1] when an immutable structure is appropriate; obtaining a new character sequence from a CODETERM2 may carry an unacceptable performance penalty, either in CPU time or memory (obtaining substrings is CPU efficient because the data is not copied, but this means a potentially much larger amount of data may remain allocated).

0	While deserializing, Gson can automatically convert JSON arrays to collections or arrays.
0	Note that SwingX is components (AFAIU) that are extensions or compositions of existing Swing components.
0	Unless you accidentally read in the whole input file instead of reading it line by line, then your primary limitation will be disk speed.

1	Actually Ive recently done some work in a system that was still running under jdk 1.3 :-(, and it was less than two years ago I was last maintaining a 1.2** system.
1	CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .
1	You can use that to create your own parser.
0	Just ran a quick test: fetching from localhost, very small document (150 bytes) x 5000 times takes roughly 10 seconds with HttpClient (4.1) and under 2 seconds with HUC.
1	If this is your own collection class rather than a built in one, you need to override its toString method.
1	Update: the high CPU usage was due to a while() loop on the ExecutorService isTerminated() method call.
1	Blah blah... It suggests to use the netbeans platform instead (which I suppose answers my question, but I have no idea what the netbeans platform is).
0	CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	It could be problem with nested folders.
1	This shows how to iterate over the lines in a stream, not how to read the entire stream into a string.
1	It always a good idea to hide underlying implementation.

1	Following is the example of Java 8 API CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	A side effect is an action that changes something outside of a method.
0	 swing component is platform independent.
1	So you have to make sure your line endings are consistent.
1	Run it on Jetty...it will be light-weight!.
0	Gson can serialize private fields and automatically ignores transient fields.
1	Why copy the inputstream to a writer?
1	TL;DR: Both are powerful, but Shiro is much easier to learn.
1	And its all.
0	Check out the [User Guide]( URL_http://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide ) to get started.
1	The resource(uri) method is defined in URL_http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/activemq/camel/trunk/components/camel-rest/sr c/test/java/org/apache/camel/rest/resources/TestSupport.java?revision=700513&v iew=markup [this-base-class] which just uses the Jersey client API.

0	This enables you to access spring beans from EJBs.
1	If you want a DOM-like API - that is, one where the XML parser turns the document into a tree of Element and Attribute nodes - then there are at least four to choose from: DOM itself, JDOM, DOM4J, and XOM.
1	Why take the whole kitchen sink when all you need is the tap?
0	 I ended up writing three classes: (1) TurnOnDebuggerException, a plain ol Java exception, (2) DebuggerPoller, a background thread the checks for the existence of a specified file on the filesystem, and (3) DebuggerMainWrapper, a class that kicks off the polling thread and then reflectively calls the main method of another specified class.
0	As a side note: Our production servers are behind a firewall, but they are exposed to some internal network segments.

0	It is no longer maintained and the support for it has been removed from NetBeans.
1	In Java CODETERM11 uses a CODETERM12 behind the scenes.
0	I think this has the inconvenience os using the platform default encoding.
0	My main goal is extracting data from it.
1	All the visual editors are nice if you only have very simple needs like putting a few buttons in a window.
0	@wufoo The problem with a more developed example is that doing things the right way would require some encoded structures for transmitting the message and IV, and the PBE parameters.
1	It looks more like a rant.
0	Early versions of Java did not have a built-in logging framework leading to this scenario.
0	Planning on posting my fixes for feedback when I get to that point.
1	Since Swing generates some code on its own so it is really helpful to use Netbeans.
1	Which one will you choose and why?
0	Thanks for the remark about SSL, this will probably drive my decision.
0	I dont think theres any framework out there that does that out of the box.
0	Were actually using a lightweight production profiler (Wily), but it isnt very good at capturing state information, and can only perform well when limited to coarse-grained traces.
0	For any sort of pc-to-pc file transfer, you need to have a listener on the destination PC.
1	To get a progress bar to show up on a form only involves dropping it onto a CODETERM2 and perhaps setting CODETERM3 so hat it shows that your program is working.
1	In this case, generate the salt with a cryptographic random number generator each time the password is changed.
1	Mixing AWT and Swing is highly unsupported and can lead to ridiculous results, such as native buttons that obscure everything else in the dialog box in which they reside because everything else was created with Swing.
0	Put the production machine behind a firewall that blocks access to the debugging port(s).
1	HttpClient has to deal with several dozen customization parameters and context specific strategies and objects.
1	EDIT: This jersey code is handled very neatly and everyone should know how to do it in servlet form if they are looking into libraries to do it for them.
0	The helpbar displays context-sensitive hints about what can be done with the selected component and suggests shortcuts that can speed up your work in the future.
0	UTF-8,the JDK will take the default encoding that is taken from System.getProperty(file.encoding,UTF-8); CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	+1 I thought the selimeter should be Z.
1	@Guillaume Cot I guess the message here is that you never should be fine with the default encoding, since you cannot be sure of what it is, depending on the platform the java code is run on.
0	In our product, I even replaced many JDK classes with our own implement.
1	@Malax Since you have access to the code, couldnt you change JSONObject#getNames to return whatever youd like in that case?
0	Definitely an up vote!.
0	Of course, there are a few working solutions, e.g.
1	But if it is initialize to 10k then you write 1 character more than 10k, it will get re-allocated and copied to a 20k array.
0	Any recommendations?
0	I have no affiliation to either product other than being a user of the free editions of yEd and DBVisualizer, and include them in this answer because using the combination of these programs can give a good preview on the library features needed for such a project, and can be used as comparison check for its results).
1	I was wondering about String.format().
1	The accepted answer covers its bases pretty well.
1	 .
0	A more direct comparison for JBoss 5 would be the GlassFish v2 releases, which are based on Java EE 5.
0	Because AWT uses native GUI widgets, your OS knows about them and handles putting them in front of each other, etc., whereas Swing widgets are meaningless pixels within a window from your OSs point of view.
1	A lot has changed since this question was asked 5 years ago.
0	For URL_http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.0.M3/spring-framework- reference/html/ch18s02.html [Restful] Id use URL_http://blog.springsource.org/2009/03/08/rest-in-spring-3-mvc/ [spring] , or URL_http://www.restlet.org/ [restlet] .
0	This just worked so we didnt look further for alternatives.
1	Swing components are generally buggier than AWT: this is false as well.
0	Fortunately I am too busy with a new job to look at this now and hopefully Ill get an answer before I have to roll up my sleeves.

0	@Mark Got it.
0	@plasma147 Instead of downvoting, consider editing the example (I just submitted that, adding Closeables.closeQuietly(stream);).
1	(3) Startup time depends which config you pick, it varies from around 3 seconds for a minimal config, to a minute or ttwo for the bells-and-whistles config.
1	Its basically a new UI framework based on Java2D.
0	If you were storing encrypted data in a database using the method above, would you store the ciphertext (blob) and the iv (char) in the database, and the password and salts would be supplied to the client application by the user or in the applications configuration files?
0	@Huxi, I maintain that the Calendar API was worse.
1	For example, URL_http://tynamo.org/tynamo-federatedaccounts+guide [ URL_http://tynamo.org/tynamo-federatedaccounts+guide ] will give you more support for federated logins in a tapestry application.
1	The original question was creating a single string, not a list of lines.
1	It is build on top of Java EE security hence Java SE hence JAAS.
0	You can refactor, for example, into CODETERM1 which calls CODETERM2 which calls CODETERM3 which calls CODETERM4 .
1	So you have to ask yourself: Are all necessary platforms supported?
1	Well, you havent said _which_ NoSQL engine youre going to, which is pretty important.

0	Charsets.UTF_8) for the CODETERM1 isnt necessary, but it is generally a good idea to specify the encoding if you know it (which you should!
0	To really think about JPA, you need to think about your data as _data_ and not organizational stuff; you have a triplet, basically, which means your NoSQL data items consist of three data items (predicate, subject, object, like youve used.)
1	In short, we had to implement some sort of custom SSO between a couple of related webapps.

0	ugh?
1	Now send the CODETERM6 and the CODETERM7 to the recipient.
0	Yes, Im very familiar with Gson, and Jersey already uses Jackson, but converting JSON to and from POJOs is only one part of the problem, Im looking for an alternative to Jersey, which is a framework for building REST-HTTP APIs.
0	OK.Thanks for your valuable suggestion.
1	It may take just a bit to get your head around some of the concepts initially, but Shiro does a very good job of hiding as much of the complexity as possible.
0	I will have a try on it...
0	Its a pity they support only mssql, oracle and sql99.
0	Thanks BalusC, I used Gson and the concept is quite simple to grasp.
0	I want to implement a tool in Java to learn more about cryptography.
0	And did you have the gall to downvote this?
0	It is never correct to use the return value of this method to allocate a buffer intended to hold all data in this stream.
1	My choice is Glassfish: it is faster to start-up, to deploy web applications.the Admin console is very accurate, moreover it is both graphical and command-line.Now it is fully-supported by Oracle, its future is not uncertain any more.It is based upon OSGi: it is really modular.You can install Spring-osgi applications easly.You can freely choice between Eclipse Link , Apache Open JPA and Hibernate without pain.It is greatly integrated in NetBeans (and, of course, Eclipse).
0	As with JavaFX, its missing some higher level components like a tree table component ( URL_https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIVOT-306 [PIVOT-306] ).
0	The alternate is to lock down the debug ports via a firewall (software or hardware.
1	Specifically you have to add the parameters inside the constructor of the URL.

1	Check out URL_http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/essential/io/scanning.html .
1	The simplest solution for many, many reasons is to use a Comet based approach (like you mention).
1	This takes 10-60 minutes on a mobilephone/hand held computer.
0	FWIW, I would choose Swing with my own home-made Guts-GUI framework :-).
1	Your initial question should have stated the exact troubleshooting steps you took - if you ran jconsole, HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError, etc.
1	Most also do not fully support the use of Java Generics.
0	Actually, Gson does not use set methods when deserializing (nor does it use get methods when serializing).
1	No need for remote calls here.
1	We use Querydsl SQL in a few of our in house projects.
1	It always puts new line char in the end of string, which may cause some weirds bugs.
1	Or to put that another way, it would look much like the equivalent Swing components when they are set to the native PLAF.
0	As of today, there are a lot of themes around.
0	It might be that the XPath term in your Binding is not finding the required element.
1	2) Please use code formatting.
1	Actually Jersey is the reference implementation of JAX-RS.
1	Now my question is in terms of what I should code against is SLF4J the right choice for the future given log4j 2.0.
1	Add a jar with the three classes mentioned above to the classpath.
1	I thought it was time for a little update, because what appears to be the best solution will take some time to implement.
1	Someone might actually use this example and introduce a bug into his code.
1	But this is fairly close to what we have in higher level languages: byte[] bytes Files.readAllBytes(someFile.toPath());.

1	It is still not able to parse any Swing code (I doubt any Swing WISIWYG editor does), but if you start with it, it gives you relatively seamless experience.You need to pay for it though.
0	Youd have to start a transaction, run a query, update the data if the query fails, in that case.
0	@Shayan So what?
1	I would suggest creating a thin logging facade that can write to any of the logging frameworks, at which point the choice of backing engine become pretty much a moot point.
0	Its not a rewrite, really, it shares nothing in common with JBossMQ at all, other than being a JMS implementation with JBoss in the title.
0	Any suggestions would be helpful.

1	The power and flexibility is necessary, but there should also a set of facade methods somewhere that simplify the process.
1	These threads use a common, synchronized file writer instance to actually write the files to disk.
0	This is a bad idea!
0	To use it you would have an object like this... CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .

1	At the end of the day, I have worked with different similar UI tools, Flash Builder, Delphi etc., but unless you do some relatively trivial UI design, not including much business logic and communication with other layers, youll have to accept that what you are capable of creating in code once you learn to do it properly is much more powerful than what any editor is capable of providing you with.

1	Haha - of course it does!
0	ConceptPk.java CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .
0	Im looking for high performance Java library for fuzzy string search.
0	There may be a much better/easier solution, but I would do the following: 1.
0	After exploring and actually using most of the major libraries listed here, I ended up writing a simplified API that is much easier to use and more fun to work with: URL_http://sharegov.blogspot.com/2011/06/json-library.html [ URL_http://sharegov.blogspot.com/2011/06/json-library.html ] .
1	As of now, it is better to use AES.
0	it might optimize the String constants out, I cant recall from the last time decompiled the byte code, but I do know that if there are any variables in there it will use a StringBuilder implementation for sure.
1	things like: create new file by a defined structure(header,data,trail).
0	 This means that your fully qualified name for your class is so we had to alter web.xml to refer to the correct class e.g: original: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	You may want to look at serialization and de-serialization .
1	I have no idea why this happens but will be great if someone can explain why?
1	Also it doesnt specify the mode; read Wikipedias Block Cipher Modes of Operation for concerns.
1	 Dont give wings to rumors.But as an alternative you can use URL_http://javafx.com/ [JavaFx] or URL_http://www.eclipse.org/swt/ [swt] or URL_http://buoy.sourceforge.net/ [buoy] .
0	What was hard to understand in the security world is just that much easier to understand.
0	This solution uses multibyte characters.
1	 - then you just call lc.login(); and authenticate the credentials.
1	thanks,ray.
1	IOUtils.toString is deprecated.
0	I am using Spring Data Graph, and the neo4j, and I have read that composed Id arent allowed.
0	so if youre parsing oracle pl/sql, ANTLR is recommended.
0	(Dang it!
1	i could say, i agree.
0	I find logging in Java to be confusing, inconsistent, poorly documented, and especially haphazard.
1	You can see this, for example, in the requirement that POJO objects need to be annotated with @XmlRootElement even though nothing I am doing involves XML.
0	UPDATE: A year ago I started actually using Jackson and I can confirm that it is awesome :-).
0	Also, since jul is contained in the java.
0	In order to make your code work, I had to use this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream() (using Eclipse with a maven project).
0	In short, please dont do this :).
0	Easily configurable via XML or Annotations.
1	However, going from JPA to NoSQL is not hard, no matter what your engine is.
0	This could be easily modelled with Spring Data Graph (or also with the pure Neo4j API) CODESNIPPET_JAVA2 .
1	But SAF has been forked since that time and still exists under the name BSAF.
0	Are those libraries able to sanely produce binary output?

1	CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	The rhino shell relies on a specially constructed scope instance called Global which defines several functions like print.
1	If you want custom mapping, you need custom coding.
0	It should be DOM based.
1	This is a very loosely defined set of questions, but i still think its valuable for anyone thinking of creating rich gui applications.
0	I have some questions about logging, more specifically about setting it up and making sure it works.
0	Also, readLine does not distinguish between n and r, so you cannot reproduce the exact stream again.
1	Difference between Swing and AWTSeveral consequences result from this difference between AWT and Swing.
1	Does it have to be done in Java?
0	@Fahim: scroll down in the code example.
0	You have full syntax autocomplete which speeds up your query-writing and makes it more error-prone.
1	First, you should choose the UI toolkit and then choose a framework that works on that toolkit.
1	See URL_http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-rs-basics.html#JAX-RSBasics- Contextannotations [Context-Annotations] .
1	Just found URL_http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/WinkProposal [Apache-Wink] in the Apache Incubator.
1	And JXTA supports it too but the configuration is complicated.
1	For classes you define, you could write a CODETERM2 class with an overloaded method for each library class you want to have handled to your own tastes: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	Changing logging backend is not a problem if you are using SLF4J Api.
1	The example is at : URL_http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?messageID=4164916 [ URL_http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?messageID=4164916 ] .
1	In that case I would serialize as text.
1	My question is: what are you doing running such an old version of JBoss?
0	Share the CODETERM1 (a CODETERM2 ) and CODETERM3 (a CODETERM4 8 bytes selected by a CODETERM5 makes a good saltwhich doesnt need to be kept secret) with the recipient out-of-band.
1	I would advise against Spring MVC for REST because it is not JAX-RS compliant.
1	Use bufferedInputStream because it supports binary reading.
0	Theres plenty of CSV libraries out there, including URL_http://commons.apache.org/sandbox/csv/ [Apache- Commons-CSV] .
0	Late, indeed.
0	The suggested steps guide has moved here: URL_http://static.springsource.org /spring-security/site/start-here.html.
0	Docs for Swing, on the other hand, are dire to nonexistent.
1	E.g.
1	If it is just about extracting parameters, then surely it is easier to stay closer to the Java standard.
1	Gson fully populates all low level values by calling all set methods for all data found in the JSON.

1	Thanks for the shout out for the Dropwizard OpenID project.
1	The W3C Document hierarchy is verbose and hard to use, so both DOM4J and JDOM try to make it easier.
0	Heres an alternative which doesnt do that, and which is (IMO) simpler to understand than the NIO code (although it still uses java.nio.charset.Charset): CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	We have a mix of 1.4.2 and 1.5 Sun JVMs running on Solaris 9 and Linux (Redhat Enterprise 4).
0	If you do have Commons IO or [Guava]( URL_http://stackoverflow.com/a/2224519/56285 ) in your project, then use that (just for code simplicity; otherwise there likely wont be a noticeable difference).
0	this doesnt generate SQL and is a nightmare to debug when it doesnt follow the rule of least astonishment ( doesnt work as expected ).
0	@Kelly: Youre welcome :).
0	First ,you have to know the encoding of string that you want to convert.Because the java.io.InputStream operates an underlying array of bytes,however,a string is composed by a array of character that needs an encoding, e,g.
1	Another option is to use URL_http://qt-jambi.org/ [Qt-Jambi] .
0	If you cant use Commons IO (FileUtils/IOUtils/CopyUtils) heres an example using a BufferedReader to read the file line by line: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	I like how this works without adding more libraries to your project.
1	This used to really come into play if you were building Applets - you wanted to target the lowest common denominator so people wouldnt have to install a newer Java plugin.
0	The trick here is that we work in blocks, and as such dont need other buffering streams.
1	The javadoc for URL_http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/F ile.html#delete%28%29 [File.delete()] public boolean delete() Deletes the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname.

1	You might want to see the discussion about Swing vs. Qt URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/422956/java-swing-or-java-qt [here] .
0	If your class sticks to the JavaBeans specification for its getters and setters, this method is straightforward to use and you dont need a schema.
0	Id be surprised if you get much benefit.
1	You can use java.nio which is faster than classical Input/Output stream: URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/io/index.html [ URL_http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/io/index.html ] .
1	I think the below answer (IOUtils.toString()) is simpler since there is no need for a StringWriter.
0	I so agree with you!
1	Real programmers dont read documentation.
1	Since the question asks specifically for a String, thats what I show, but if you can work with the CharBuffer returned by decode, the memory requirement is much less.
1	Youre absolutely right: the Java Debugging API is inherently insecure.
0	@ItayMoav-Malimovka, well... in the case of JOOQ, if I change something in my DB structure, my code will just stop compiling until I fix it according to new DB structure.
1	The array is owned by a org.jboss.axis.message.SAX2EventRecorder which is in turn held by these guys: org.jboss.axis.message.SOAPEnvelopeAxisImpl@0x19c31fd8 (141 bytes) : field recorderorg.jboss.axis.message.RPCParamElementImpl@0x19c32260 (123 bytes) : field recorderorg.jboss.axis.message.SOAPBodyAxisImpl@0x19c32160 (121 bytes) : field recorderorg.jboss.axis.message.RPCElement@0x19c321e0 (124 bytes) : field recorderorg.jboss.axis.encoding.DeserializationContextImpl@0x19c332f0 (67 bytes) : field recorderorg.jboss.axis.message.SAX2EventRecorder$objArrayVector@0x19c33398 (24 bytes) : field this$0 The data structures of our own app are quete bloated, but not to this degree.
1	And one more thing we are taking only a one scenario (matching patterns) but when our requirements will grow the same code written by our own servlets will become more complicated and complex.
1	Note that there is currently a bug which prevents some of the examples to work ( URL_https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIVOT-858 [PIVOT-858] ) in your browser.
0	On the other hand, I disagree with Guillaume also.
0	JAAS is a security framework build for securing things at a much lower level then web-application.
1	The easiest thing to do is to go to URL_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL and pick any of the technologies mentioned there.
1	The problem was that when I the //do stuff runs, it takes a while, and it doesnt let me do anything else.
0	The following is my understanding of the different frameworks, please correct me if im wrong.
0	Also: bouncycastle doesnt require you to run inside that security sandbox stuff (which is mostly for applets - remember them?
0	java.net versus java.nio.
0	But it is a state of preference.
0	 Update: To clarify - I did do memory dump, and the dump shows an array or 4,000,000+ objects, Strings and Integers.

0	Thank you for indicating that there are times when this is necessary.
1	Note that if you test your server from a different machine, you need to replace localhost by either the IP address of your server or its domain name if it has one defined.
0	Same with BufferedReaders readLine().
1	If it was rubbish, I would not have been motivated to correct one minor misunderstanding.
0	This is due to problems with invalidation of Hibernates 2nd level cache when running several client applications working with the same datasource.
0	This shows how to iterate over the lines in a stream, not how to read the entire stream into a string.
1	 Copy this code into all your projects.

0	However, you need to be very familar with both models to see the parallels.
0	A better alternative to Jersey/Jackson for building JSON REST APIs?
1	Another alternative, is to create a CODETERM25 implemenation by sub- classing CODETERM26 , and adding counters to track the number of characters on every CODETERM27 and other mutation operations of the list, then override CODETERM28 to create a CODETERM29 of the exact size you need and loop through the list and build the output, you can even make that CODETERM30 an instance variable and cache the results of CODETERM31 and only have to re-generate it when something changes.

1	What you dont say is, why is not a good practice to do it.
0	Yeah, it really shouldnt require so much boilerplate to do something as simple as read strings from a stream.
0	This way the library can always use the same logging framework (via commons logging) that the hosting application uses.

0	Jersey does seem to mach the requirements quite adequately, although I have not given other frameworks enough investigation yet.
0	Yes, I will use BufferedReader because I have a text file and I need to read it line by line.Now I have another problem: I cannot detect the size of the new file when writing it.The idea is that when the size of the new file xx MB then generate a new file.

1	Does String x A + B; really compile to be a StringBuilder?
0	I heard that apparently Swing is being developed no longer.

0	I now know that Im not going to be using log4j as my default framework any more.
0	While GSON has reasonable feature set, I thought performance was sort of weak spot (as per [ URL_http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2009/09/entry_326.html])As to example: I thought GSON did not really need setters, and was based on fields.
0	As Im using eclipse, I use the Visual Editor plugin.
1	It is not related to Swing and AWT at all.
1	Or in this case, IOUtils.toString(inputStream, encoding).
1	Netbeans has some GUI-building support, and its one of the most popular Java IDEs on the market.
1	Most of our hand-written code concerned itself with connecting events to actions, simply asking the layout for the relevant controls.

1	JFormDesigner also works with JBuilder and Eclipse, so you are not locking your projects to one particular IDE.
1	 Note: This answer largely replaces my Java 6 version.
1	I dont think there are any modern 3rd party libraries that feature anything especially useful thats missing from the stl and the standard libraries have the usual advantages of being extremely well tested, documented and stable.
1	By the way, the same rationale applies to setters, but Id use an IllegalArgumentException there.
0	Cheers mate, I will try that when I can stop hiding from the big scary dead line looming over me :).
1	 Performance: Swing components are generally slower and buggier than AWT, due to both the fact that they are pure Java and to video issues on various platforms.

1	I knew exactly what I wanted to achieve in terms of HTTP logic, cookies, session ids and stuff, and what should happen in what order, but I spent the better part of a day struggling with the Spring Security APIs, and still could not figure out exactly what class or interface I shoud implement or override, and how to plug them in the context.
0	SLF4J supports bridging of commons.logging, LOG4J and (a bit cumbersome, but as good as possible) java.util.logging so all logs will end up in whatever SLF4J backend youll use.
0	There you have it, now NPE points to correct line and thus correct method which threw the actual NPE.
0	Strange as this sounds, but there is a great deal of similarity between AppEngine Datastore and the Lotus Domino: you may need to write an abstraction layer to handle the two APIs, but the capabilities are quite similar.

0	You should throw an IllegalArgumentException if (length < 0).
0	First, if your file contains binary data, then using CODETERM1 would be a big mistake (because you would be converting the data to String, which is unnecessary and could easily corrupt the data); you should use a CODETERM2 instead.
1	Heads Up: Its BounCycastle, not BounTycastle.
1	The problem with QueryDsl is that you cant use it as a pure query generator as it does not give you the generated query itself.
1	Important Update: The app is developed in Java so ideally the Data Abstraction Layer or any alternatives must be Java friendly.
0	From the CODETERM5 javadoc (and is repeated in the respective CODETERM6 methods from the other classes): _The contents of the character array are copied; subsequent modification of the character array does not affect the newly created string._ So youll end up having a possibly big memory copy operation after the fast filling of the array.

1	Youre likely to be using a number of components which may all use different logging APIs.
1	Ive just ran into some problems with Jackson, Hibernate and Spring, however, I dont know if this issue is related to Jackson or Spring or Hibernate ... see URL_http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3325387/infinite-recursion-with - jackson-json-and-hibernate-jpa-issue.
1	That means that in the example above, youd store the result of tmp.getEncoded() as the hash.
0	I think Alex B is right when he says that objectively the API is bad and could have been better.
0	So, it is recommendable to use CODETERM4 ( unless of course you have more than one thread accessing to it at the same time, which is rare ) CODETERM5 concatenation ( _using the + operator_ ) may be optimized by the compiler to use CODETERM6 underneath, so, it not longer something to worry about, in the elder days of Java, this was something that everyone says should be avoided at all cost, because every concatenation created a new String object.
0	With respect to JavaFXs webview, its based on webkit URL_http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/webview/jfxpub-webview.htm and from a few short tests that i have done it seems to work fine with js in general (including jquery and jqueryui).

0	Methods that use the platform default encoding are almost never correct to use, like every other method that gives different results depending on which machine/operating system/platform or version thereof it is run on.
0	(There are better 3rd party native looking skins than Swings implementations BTW) Lots of people preferred using AWTs FileDialog over Swings FileChooser because it gave the platform file dialog most people were used to rather than the weird custom Swing one.

0	The purpose is simlply to remove timezone data from the element when unmarshalling data.
0	Please specify the encoding - its a very common bug.
0	Its a crime that code generation is the default way to layout code in Java because better ways of doing GUIs have been around for decades.
1	JMS works better on GlassFish - this applies to GF vs. JBoss 4.X.As far as I see the JMS implementation was drastically modified inJBoss 5.X, so maybe this claim is no longer true 4.
1	Instead of putting each server on different ports, is it possible to use channel selectors on the client side, or is it better to go multi-threaded io on the client side of things and configure the servers differently?

1	Lets start with AWT, Swing, SwingX - the Swing way.
0	For reading large files, you need a different design for your program, one that reads a chunk of text from a stream, processes it, and then moves on to the next, reusing the same fixed-sized memory block.
1	:) Here are a couple: AWT is a cross-platform interface, so even though it uses the underlying OS or native GUI toolkit for its functionality, it doesnt provide access to everything that those toolkits can do.

0	 Features: Swing supports a wider range of features like icons and pop-up tool-tips for components.
0	I thing that we both agree that this method isnt thread-safe in many ways.
1	According to the [documentation](htt p://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html#available%28%29 ) of the available() method, there is no guarantee that the end of file is reached in the event that the method returns 0.

1	I cant speak for Spring, but it is straightforward to move your business logic in to the EJB tier using Session Beans.
0	You should check it out.
0	Actually, if you want a lightweight solution and dont need transactions or clustering just use Spring support for RMI.
0	The answer depends on how you view (the contract of) your getters.
0	I had to add if (is null) return ; right at the beginning of the method; I believe this answer needs to be updated to better handle null inputStreams.

1	Place each getter on its own line and debug.
1	So, Ive come to the conclusion that Apache HttpComponents 4 is one of the most overwrought APIs Ive ever come across.
1	 Would it not be easier (for future developers) and faster (to implement and learn) to map the url pattern CODETERM1 to a servlet and have a line or two that parses the url for the parameters instead of learning, implementing and configuring one of these libraries to do it for you.

1	) Tutorial Comments** Overall Im not sure exactly who the tutorial was aimed at - because there is a fair degree of assumed knowledge all round, so coming into REST and Restlet framework cold leaves you with a lot of catchup work to do, and re-reading paragraphs over and over again.
1	So when the application needs to be run only in a single thread then it is better to use CODETERM7 .

0	Edited it..........
1	The reason it works is because URL_http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html [Scanner] iterates over tokens in the stream, and in this case we separate tokens using beginning of the input boundary (A) thus giving us only one token for the entire contents of the stream.

1	NM Ill file separate question and for now look at: URL_http://mailman.qos.ch/pipermail/logback-user/2007-May/000209.html .
0	The tiny key of DES can be broken in hours or days using a few thousand dollars worth of equipment.
1	But that JSON library could still stink for other reasons (never used them personally, but I know were using them at work).
0	@erickson Im new here, not sure how this works but would you be interested in bounty points to fix up Dougs code?
1	Shiro works great in Spring environments, so I would say choose based on which of the two you enjoy more and makes the most sense to you.

1	Fixed.
0	@Pelegi, can you mention just one thing that JBoss does better than Glassfish?
0	The web site looks great.
0	Thanks for alerting me.
1	Most Web browsers do not include the Swing classes, so the Java plugin must be used.
1	Sorry this was more than two years ago and I havent done any Java since.
0	Some parsers do not understand things like CSS.
1	It provides a set of viewers (model driven) similar to a lot of Swing models.
0	There are 2 bug reports filed with Axis URL_https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS-2698 [AXIS-2698] URL_https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS-2749 [AXIS-2749] See also URL_https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS-1771 [AXIS-1771] , it has some interesting information regarding deserialization and ways to mediate its impact.
1	Tika is one of them that was previously a component of Apache Lucene.
1	Any algorithm where order is important can not, by definition, be thread safe.
1	FWIW, XStream with Badgerfish (jettison) does handle them (since its full object-serialization framework, although resulting json looks ugly, as its xml based, just converts to json via badgerfish).
0	check this out: URL_http://igorpolevoy.blogspot.com/2011/01/java-rest-with - ease.html thanks igor.
1	Swing is outdated (maybe less so but not much work has been done on Swing for the past 10 years).
1	user268098: I think most Java JSON handling libraries have issues with cyclic dependencies, and most have some ways to either exclude just references, or handle them with annotations (I added an answer in the other question to point out one way to do that with Jackson).
0	@netbrain : Yes, you can run Pivot as desktop app (JFrame) or applet (JApplet).
0	DarkSquids method is vulnerable to password attacks and also doesnt work unless your plaintexts size is a multiple of AESs block size (128 bits) because he left out padding.
1	I thought log4j was a terrific thing, worthy of being made a standard.
0	So the replacement code needs to to adapted in order to fit in his solution.
1	Swing components are platform-independent.
1	2) contains an error, it adds always null at the end of the string as you are always makeing one more step then necessary.
1	TurnOnDebuggerException can be any exception guaranteed not to be thrown anywhere else.
0	Also little improvement would be to use apache io (or other) constant for character encoding instead of using plain string literal - eg: IOUtils.toString(myInputStream, Charsets.UTF_8);.
0	 Option 1 Disable CODETERM1 (your second jboss-web.xml), bundle your Hibernate JARs into your app and add the following properties to your CODETERM2 (to avoid the issue youre facing): CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	But these things are not working in a restful web service.
1	Its working great!.
1	I also think that using read() with arguments like read(Char[], int init, int end) is a better way to read a such a large file(Eg : read(buffer,0,buffer.length)) And I also experienced the problem of missing values of using the BufferedReader instead of BufferedInputStreamReader for a binary data input stream.
1	Really easy to map JSON to almost any java object by only annotating the class using JsonElement and then passing the java and class to JsonReader like: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
1	I can specify a 16bit one which works for 128bit encryption which works.
0	A + B is a contrived example for sure.
1	 more edit:** nixed try/catch, Patricks way is more laconic.
0	Of course, you could choose other character encodings besides UTF-8.
1	Swing is still the preferred way to build heavy-weight, e.g.
1	Im afraid not Matt Ball :/.
1	As URL_http://stackoverflow.com/a/9503506/27657 [NimChimpsky-mentioned] restlet will do this out of the box.
1	grrrr Any good links - much appreciated.
0	part of them on AWT Components, part on Swing JCompoentns, but between AWT and Swing is difference with implemented, accesible and inherits methods, for example Swing JComponents directly (API) implements lots of inherit or nested methods directly from AWT :-).
