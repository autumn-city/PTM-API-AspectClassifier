0	After you have your byte[] you can simply do: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .
0	This helps design secure systems that prevent injection attacks.
1	It generates proper (actually readable) source code, its very ergonomic and intuitive and, above all, very extensible.
0	If the framework is easy enough to adopt then you should be able to go from vanilla to the framework with more ease than from another framework, when the need arises.

1	Also, depending on database platform, details needed and authorization levels used the results yielded might differ.
1	(Before you ask, some of the libraries you mention will merrily install themselves as servlets; this allows your code to just describe the business logic of the servlet and declare how mapping to the wire is done in abstract terms.

1	I can live with this being closed (voting to reopen, though), but please lets not delete it (it is awfully close to that).
1	But its incredible that they can fix it.
1	The download speed is maxed out though, so this is not an issue.

0	You can use URL_https://github.com/samtingleff/jchronic [JChronic] , the Java port of URL_http://chronic.rubyforge.org/ [Chronic] .
1	If you need advanced components (more than NetBeans offers) you can easily integrate SwingX without problems (or JGoodies) as the NetBeans platform is completely based on Swing.
1	Basically AWT came first and is a set of heavyweight UI components (meaning they are wrappers for operating system objects) whereas Swing built on top of AWT with a richer set of lightweight components.
1	and hows your experience with dom4j?
1	any ideas about performance of Scanner vs reading the stream in a more verbose way?
0	Unlike both mentioned earlier NetBeans editor andWidnowBuilder it uses lazy initialization pattern to separateinitialization of components.

1	I came for a solid HTML Parser, and left with one that I wont have to spend the time to generalize.
0	But how can I easily print them in a readable format?
1	This separation between the API and the implementation is similar to the one between the Servlet API and Web containers like Jetty or Tomcat, or between the JDBC API and concrete JDBC drivers.
1	So, using the BufferedInputStreamReader is a much better in this like case.
0	Stability?
1	While taking a heap dump can help to gather state information, its often easier to use a remote debugger.
1	It takes TCP a little whiel to find the optimal window size, so if you use parallel connections, this process goes 3x faster!.
1	Thanks for the comments.
1	@ArchimedesTrajano Not with the Java Cryptography Architecture.
1	Its a mix of the two packages.
0	ServletContainer class will take care of this (parsing url in its service method) and there are lots of other classes also which will make your task easier.
1	However, it doesnt work very well.
0	Id suggest using slf4j, since it can use log4j as a backend if thats what you need.
1	so I have implemented my own ORM file to objects and vise versa.

1	I am currently considering URL_http://code.google.com/p/redis/ [redis] + URL_http://code.google.com/p/jredis/ [jredis] One of my main motivations for this project is also to look into the programming model and ways of usage of NoSql DBs.
1	I havent ever really seen it being used in projects.
1	URL_http://lucene.apache.org/ [Apache-Lucene] is the only way, I think.
1	IMHO if you dont need something like powerful GUI support or Java2D (most of which can be done with JQuery, ExtJS, etc) there is no real argument for applets.
0	@fooMonster Ive edited the answer.
0	In addition, the qualified named suggested in the tutorial is indeed firstStepsServlet.FirstStepsApplication and not com.firstStepsServlet.FirstStepsApplication.
0	The default size of the buffer is 1024, but Scanner will increase the size as necessary (see Scanner#makeSpace()).
1	I am not sure if there will be any encoding issues.
1	The context has to be initialized with the used classes, but you just have to specify the root classes and dont have to worry about static referenced classes.You use annotations to specify which classes should be elements (@XmlRootElement) and which fields are elements(@XmlElement) or attributes (@XmlAttribute, what a surprise!
1	We want to push data from a server to clients but can only use HTTP (port 80).
0	 <strike>** URL_https://github.com/sonatype/async-http-client [Async-http-client] by Sonatype</strike>.
1	Its very cool, very great, but the second you want to do anything other than simple objects, you could easily need to start building your own serializers (which isnt _that_ hard).
1	Still worth mentioning :).
1	 awt require javax.awt package.
1	It handles internationalization schemes and dynamic calls without breaking.
1	Thanks for pointing out the bugs - I saw the first two, but not the last one.

0	If you are just reading straight through a file, this will most likely not get you much of anything.
0	With the following caveats: As with normal Java serialization coding and decoding run over a InputStream and OutputStream the process uses the familar writeObject and readObject methods In contrast to normal Java serialization the encoding but also decoding causes constructors and initializers to be invoked encoding and decoding work regardless if your class implements Serializable or not transient modifiers are not taken into account works only for public classes, that have public constructors For example, take the following declaration: CODESNIPPET_JAVA1 .

0	The whole point of using InputStream is, that a) you dont know the length of the _complete_ stream (which bails out anything depending on available) and b) the stream can be anything - a file, a socket, something internal (which bails out anything based on File.size()).

0	Taking into account file one should first get a CODETERM1 instance.
1	clogging has its own way of discovering what framework it will use - its not nice and rather convuluted.
0	Well, usually its actually A + B + C because people are lazy ;) I tended to always use a StringBuilder, even if it was only two strings being concatenated, because in future, perhaps more strings would be appended.
1	Java logging is not my favorit, but this could be because i use log4j from the beginning.
1	@netbrain Thanks back at you for asking an interesting, well researched question.
0	Perhaps youre better off just upgrading to JBoss AS 5?
1	Worth mentioning that since version 1.4, Java had the classes java.beans.XMLEncoder and java.beans.XMLDecoder.
0	Connect SLF4J to your favorite backend (Log4J, Logback...) by putting CODETERM3 in the classpath.
1	Since youre using buffer variable locally with no chance of being shared across multiple threads you should consider changing its type to StringBuilder, to avoid the overhead of (useless) synchronization.

1	I agree with both you (+1) and the OP.
1	Regarding memory, there shouldnt be any problem if you use a decently sized buffer (Id use at least 1MB to make sure the HD is doing mostly sequential reading and writing).
1	Are there other ideas or frameworks which offer lets say JMS over HTTP.
1	Its not free but its a bargain for the power you get (129 EUR / 159 USD).
1	Can log4j be used as a dumpster instead?
1	Though, I found quite obvious configuration settings left out in their latest documentations, but I guess this must have been improved since then.
1	Matisse did use to have an extra dependency on GroupLayout but now its included in jre so there is no dependency on SAF.
0	GraphXML files exported from yFiles (and yFiles based windows in DBVisualizer) can be edited / (re)formatted in the (free) yEd Graph editor.
1	I would hazard a guess that any performance loss would be small, or could be handled by every once in a while logging them to a file and destroying the old String objs.
0	In the project Im starting, do you recommend that I use SL4J for my own logging purposes?
1	No it isnt.
